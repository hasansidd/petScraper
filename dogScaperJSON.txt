    "description": "Warren Hood is better known as Fennec by his foster - like a Fennec Fox! This adorable dog with the magical ears has come a long way to get where he is today. Fennec is a lover of humans, cuddles, play time, and zoomies. He somehow manages to combine gorgeous athleticism with endearing awkwardness. He\u0027ll soar through the air in a game of chase but toss him a ball and he\u0027s like that infamous video of a retriever missing the treat catch in hilarious slow motion. Awkward catching skills or no, he\u0027s quite a smartypants who learns quickly and enjoys showing off his puzzle toy solving skills. Fennec is now putting those smarts to work as part of Dogs Out Loud, a training program to help shelter dogs meet their full potential. He is kicking some serious tushy on his training goals and building himself quite a fan club along the way. Fennec has been saved twice from shelter euthanasia, no easy feat for a sensitive bully breed boy. He\u0027s hoping his luck holds and takes him all the way home to stay this time! To learn more about Fennec or set up a time to meet him, email [email protected]!"

    "description": "Mickey is a fabulous walker on his leash, eager for neighborhood walks. And he likes playing with soft toys and is fun to watch as he zooms around the play yard. He\u0027d love access to a little pool for some happy splashing. He is good at leaving cats alone, and even seems a little scared of them. Mickey will be a great addition to an adult-only home, where his people can take him for walks, chill on the couch with him and let him be their adorable watchdog. Mickey plays very well the dogs in his playgroup, if sometimes rowdy with smaller dogs. He just wants to be in charge of the group, so he\u0027s happiest when his playmates are on the submissive side, big or small. He currently lives with three larger dogs and enjoys thinking he is the boss of them. He\u0027s somewhat the opposite with humans. He\u0027s fearful with strangers and can be nippy with people he doesn\u0027t know and trust, especially children who approach his kennel. He prefers females over males, but can warm up to males. He needs to have a human who isn\u0027t afraid of him and understands how to handle his \"naughty\" behavior. But once he gets well acquainted and comfortable, he becomes his human friend\u0027s cuddle buddy, happy to hang out by his person\u0027s side, or even in her lap. He can be a loyal little guard dog, ready to alert his person to any evil that might be lurking. He is always alert, and may do best in a non-apartment home. Come meet this little guy today!"

    "description": "Although Boscoe is entering into his senior years, this enthusiastic guy can still run and goof off with the best of them, and he can\u0027t wait to find his forever home to share his retirement years with! Boscoe is house and crate-trained, though he\u0027s very well behaved if he\u0027s allowed to wander the house, and he does a marvelous job of keeping himself entertained. Boscoe adores his squeaky toys and loves to toss them around. This smart pooch has mastered sit, down, and shakes with both paws. He picks up on new skills very quickly and really aims to please. It\u0027s not difficult to convince Boscoe of most things as long as you have a little food! He does well in a fenced in yard and he loves the opportunity to run around and be silly! Playful, entertaining and a total cuddlebug, this sweet pup has a huge soft spot for people and would do just about anything for them."

    "description": "Shamrock is a toy lover. And if you wonder what his favorite toys are, it\u0027s your dirty socks and underwear! Shamrock is restarting his life. He was found downtown in a box and was practically skin and bones. Since he\u0027s been in foster care, he\u0027s gained weight and although he\u0027s a low-energy boy, he loves to play and even do zoomies around the house. Then he\u0027ll ask to come up on the couch for a snuggle. He really gets energetic when his foster mom comes home from work, wagging his entire body and giving little kisses. And he\u0027s especially happy if he sees a new toy to play tug-o-war with. Speaking of playing, he loves his female chihuahua housemate and tries to get her to play all the time. Shamrock is crate and house trained, and freely roams his apartment when his mom is away with no problems. He has been diagnosed with diabetes, which is managed with easy-to-give daily insulin shots that he takes like a trooper. He does enjoy car rides and looking out the window as the world goes by. A home with a small yard where Shamrock could snooze and sunbathe would be a bonus. But he\u0027ll welcome any home where he can get the love and care he wants and needs. Come meet this special boy!"

    "description": "Marilla is delightful in all the ways dogs can be - goofy, cuddly, and completely unaware of her size. Marilla loves two things more than anything else in this world - fetch and belly rubs. If she has a choice between a ball or a new friendly person to beg for bellyrubs, she will agonize over it for a few moments, then usually chooses the belly rubs. And if she can get some playtime in water, even better. She has been labeled the \"Mermaid of Lady Bird Lake\" as she can be spotted at this watering hole on a sunny day, swimming the day away. Marilla\u0027s default assumption when meeting new people is that they are new best friends. She cannot get close enough to people and will wind herself all around you trying to get as many body parts touching as possible. Marilla also enjoys learning new things and is in the Total Obedience Program (TOP), which is modeled after the AKC\u0027s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Marilla has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help her learn the skills to become the best dog she can be! She is learning skills like sit and down, walking nicely on leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers or other dogs, staying in a sit or down until told \"free,\" and coming when called. Once Marilla successfully completes all the skills on her training plan she will be considered TOP Dog Ready! Marilla is working hard to become a wonderful pet and as a part of APA\u0027s Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with Marilla after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA\u0027s CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https://vimeo.com/89434193"

    "description": "Sparky is a sparkler of a boy and really just a giant lovebug who thinks he\u0027s a lapdog. This sweetie\u0027s foster says he\u0027s one of the most cuddly dogs she\u0027s ever been around. He loves to lay his head in his person\u0027s lap while they stroke his head or just snuggle on the bed or couch. Sparky has occasional bursts of energy, but he\u0027s mostly a calm, well-mannered pup who walks well on leash. He\u0027s also crate trained, house-trained and answers to \"sit\" and \"come\", though he\u0027s still working on \"stay\". When he\u0027s in a playful mood, Sparky loves to play with his squeaky toys and he\u0027s happiest when his human throws the toy for him to chase or plays tug-o-war with him. Sometimes he\u0027ll play fetch the toy and bring it back, but he mostly just likes to throw it to himself. Sparky will be a wonderful addition to a home where he can be a companion to someone who wants to give him love, snuggles and long walks with lots of time for sniffing. Come meet him and see if he\u0027s right for yours."

    "description": "Chubbs is a dog who is in love with life. He adores chasing balls, exploring his world when out for a walk or run, and then settling down for all kinds of cuddling and love. He\u0027s not above telling you that you are not nearly finished with the belly rubs should you stop too soon! Chubbs is a people-pleasing ball full of love. He should take to training easily and is going to want to be an active participant in the life of his forever family. He has shown appropriate interest in other dogs he meets. He\u0027s a strong, athletic boy who would likely be a great running, hiking or walking buddy but will happily run off a lot of energy chasing those balls. He loves playing fetch and is quite talented at it. If you would like to play and cuddle to your heart\u0027s content with an appreciative, happy, goofy, adorable wonderful young dog who would like nothing more than to be yours forever, please come meet Chubbs real soon!"

No matter what he\u0027s doing, though, he\u0027s doing it with a huge grin and a huge tongue hanging out! His big smile and his wiggly butt are hard to resist. APA!\u0027s favorite little hippo lives big and loves big. We can\u0027t wait for him to get into a home where his big love is reciprocated and where he gets all the snuggling he can handle.

But if you could take a moment and visit Loki, you\u0027ll see that he is a total love-bug. He has that look that says, \"Want to have some fun together?\" Once you get him leashed up and out the door, he is full of life! He can lope around the ball fields with a big, goofy grin! No matter what he\u0027s doing, he seems very proud of himself as he struts his stuff. His true joyful nature comes out when he\u0027s outside having fun. His other favorite hobby is loving up on his humans. He is a very affectionate cuddlebug. He loves being around his favorite people, giving them kisses, cuddling on their laps and spooning in bed with them. He brings toys to his human friends for playtime, plays tug-o-war, chases tennis balls, and then does zoomies in the yard. He\u0027s a smart, treat motivated boy who already answers to a host of hand signal commands - including \"sit,\" \"lay down\" and \"shake.\" And he\u0027s crate-trained and seems house trained and is great in the car. If you\u0027ve got treats, he\u0027s willing to learn new tricks. Loki is a loving, loyal boy will be eager to please an active family and who can give him the affection he wants and will return in abundance. If that\u0027s not incentive enough, his adoption fee is paid. Won\u0027t you come visit him today? Please check out his Instagram @adoptloki.apa to learn more about Loki!"

This silly pup shows his affection for his favorite pal through playful headbutts, and is also doing well in playgroup with his doggy friends! He\u0027ll be a great companion for an active adult household and another household dog. He also knows how to sit, down, place, \"beg\" and shake.

    "description": "There\u0027s just something about Chewy! When this short little sausage roll struts by with his ears bouncing, tail wagging, hips swaying, and a tennis ball or his favorite Lamb Chop toy in his mouth, everyone he passes has to smile and maybe even laugh...it really is impossible not to. This \"Chewy Effect is also transmitted through a camera - don\u0027t believe us? We dare you to look at his pictures and video without smiling or feeling a warm, fuzzy feeling in your heart. Chewy is a delight and has quite the fan base at the shelter. His passion and skill for fetching are known far and wide - he dares you to tell him he\u0027s a senior pup! In between fetching sessions, he\u0027s been known to plop down on the floor and roll the ball back and forth to you with his nose. Not only is Chewy housebroken, a comedian, and a stellar athlete...he\u0027s also a scholar. Chewy enjoys learning new things and is in the Total Obedience Program. The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modelled after the AKC\u0027s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Chewy has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help him learn the skills to become the best dog he can be! Chewy is learning skills like sit and down, walking nicely on leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers or other dogs, staying in a sit or down until told \"free,\" and coming when called. Once Chewy successfully completes all the skills on his training plan he will be considered TOP Dog Ready! Chewy is working hard to become a wonderful pet and as a part of APA\u0027s Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with Chewy after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA\u0027s CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https://vimeo.com/89434193 Come play a round of fetch with Chewy, so you can witness the Chewy Effect and the joy it brings in person! You can also follow Chewy on Instagram (yeah, he\u0027s that cool...) https://www.instagram.com/adopt_chewy/"

    "description": "Brasco is well mannered, goofy sweetheart! He is so loving and has the cutest ear perk and tail wag when he\u0027s with his people. He can\u0027t wait to show his forever family what a wonderful companion he is! Brasco is house-trained, does very well in his crate and enjoys a good snooze while he\u0027s there. He will joyfully jump in and adorably wait for a treat. He\u0027s a master on his leash or harness, and knows several commands. He understands \"heel and will always walk next to you when you ask him to. Brasco will patiently sit and wait for his food to be set down, never jumps on the furniture, and is very well behaved. He really is an awesome pooch! He likes to take his time in getting comfortable with new people before he shows much affection. Once he\u0027s there though, he is the cuddle king! He wants very much to be a tiny lap dog, and really commits to it sometimes. It\u0027s pretty hilarious to watch him try! This sweet pooch will lovingly put his paw on your knee when he\u0027s sitting next to you, and loves belly rubs! Once you\u0027ve won this guy over he really is the epitome of respectful, loving, and eager. This goofy dog adores his tennis balls, and will happily chase them around the yard! He will also lope around the house carrying and squeaking it trying to see if anyone is up for some tug of war. When it\u0027s time to go for a walk, this fella is 100% all in! This active guy also adores car rides. He will proudly sit in the back seat as though he\u0027s the coolest pup in town! This respectful guy would do wonderfully in a home that enjoys being active. He loves to go on walks, and would be thrilled to get several in throughout the day. Although he does fine alone, he really thrives when his people are close. Even though he\u0027s a bigger pooch, he\u0027s incredibly mindful, gentle, and easy to take care of. He just wants a loving, patient home to help him warm up to people and be the best dog he can be. Brasco also enjoys learning new things and is in the Total Obedience Program. The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modelled after the AKC\u0027s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Brasco has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help him learn the skills to become the best dog he can be!

    "description": "Galaxy is APA\u0027s version of Princess Leia with eyes that sparkle brighter than stars in the sky when she sees the people she loves. This affectionate, sometimes goofy girl can be shy when first meeting new humans, but once she gets comfortably acquainted, she lights up and her personality shines. She loves, loves and loves her human friends and wants to cuddle with them, sneaking in kisses and curling up in their laps. Galaxy is happy to take walks and play with toys, then lay next to her people and ask for petting. And if it\u0027s been a while since you gave her a treat, she\u0027ll put her paw on your arm as a polite reminder. Galaxy has great leash skills and is crate and house trained. Quick to learn, Galaxy is in the Total Obedience Program. The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modeled after the AKC\u0027s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Galaxy has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help her learn the skills to become the best dog she can be!

Very lady-like unless there\u0027s a nice patch of grass to roll back and forth in? Check! Santana\u0027s perfect day is a long, leisurely hike followed by a snooze in your lap. She is a perfect lady in the house and quite a beauty! She is sure to improve your decor just by lying on the couch.

    "description": "Whiskey has had a very eventful life. Rescued from an abusive situation as a puppy, and bounced around from shelter to shelter, he wants nothing more than to finally find his person. And when he does, he will provide them with boundless love, loyalty and affection. If you are looking for a ride or die kind of love, then you should consider Whiskey. Whiskey is house trained, and comfortable in a crate. Though he is not too keen on sharing his family with other dogs, outside of his home he loves to play. He can moderate his style appropriately, going from a ruff and tumble session with big dogs to a gentle nudge with smaller dogs. Though he loves a good romp, he is equally fond of naps and lounging on the couch. Really, being with his people is his favorite thing. He is up for anything, as long as you\u0027re there. You will have the ultimate protector in Whiskey, a dog who will guard against physical threats, and comfort you from the more existential ones. He\u0027s the type of dog who totally knows when you had a bad day, and will up his snuggle game accordingly. Whiskey is not for a casual dog owner. He is for someone who is looking for a soul mate. If you think you\u0027re in the market, you should come meet him."

    "description": "Fredrick has a sweet, bashful smile that sums up his entire being. He can act like a delicate wallflower when you first meet him, but once he is comfortable, he is all about being up in your personal space. He is a pro-level cuddler. Fredrick walks great on a leash. He has good manners and is very focused on his person. Which is fortunate, because taking walks is his favorite thing. He\u0027d rather do that than fetch or wrestle with other dogs. He would do best in a home with a yard, as he loves being outside. He\u0027d like to split his time equally between the grass and your lap, if he could. He learned sit, and has proven to be smart and eager to please. All you really need to fall in love with Fredrick is to look into his eyes. He just has the warmest, most soulful eyes. When he gives you a little hopeful tail wag, it\u0027ll be all over. If you\u0027re ready, come meet him!"

    "description": "Petunia is an easy going, playful love bug. Her current foster says her favorite thing to do is chase critters in the yard. She\u0027s always on a hunting excursion. She\u0027s also equally content to hang around close to her people and observe. Sweet Petunia loves to cuddle, and will gently ask for chin scratches, ear rubs, and belly pats. She does very well with other dogs, and seems to really like kids. She is an angel in her crate, walks wonderfully on her leash, and always comes when she\u0027s called. She doesn\u0027t bark much, and is an eager learner. She truly aims to please. Petunia does require a little TLC as she struggles with incontinence. She is on some prescription food that helps her out, and she\u0027s content to wear a diaper if that\u0027s a preference. It\u0027s pretty adorable too! There\u0027s nothing quite like the awesome greeting this girl will give her people when they get home! She\u0027s full of excitement! Her foster raves about her beautiful soulful eyes, and her cute \"1st position ballet dancer turned out legs. Petunia is such a wonderful companion, and is excited to find her forever family. She would love having other dog siblings, and would do well with kids in the home as well. She has so much love to give, and can\u0027t wait to have it so deservedly returned. Come meet this little lady! She\u0027ll win you over with her spunk!"

    "description": "We know, we know...Zoe is friggin\u0027 adorable. Yesssss, we also know she\u0027s tiny and scruffy and OMG you have to have her. We totally get all that. BUT.......... Here\u0027s the thing with Zoe, though: We don\u0027t think Zoe was born with all her marbles. Or, maybe she lost her marbles at a young age. What we\u0027re trying to say is that this adorable little fluffy-faced dog is, wellllll, let\u0027s just say she\u0027s \"unique\" in case she figures out how to read and gets her paws on this Bio (hey don\u0027t laugh, she\u0027s REALLY smart). Zoe has been happily ruling over, errr, we mean living in a Foster home since the beginning of the year. Based on what we\u0027ve learned about her, we do think the right home for this maniacal muppet exists. The rub, though, is that this home might very well not be you. Here\u0027s what we think purely the home dynamics need to look like: - Only one to two adults for the foreseeable future - No other pets for the foreseeable future - Friends, family, visitors that will actually LISTEN to you when you tell them how to act around your dog Don\u0027t get us wrong, Zoe has tons of positively delightful qualities. She is very energetic and loves to play, nails the whole \"going to the bathroom outside\" thing, is wicked smart (that might not actually ALWAYS be a positive, see above), and is super affectionate and snuggly. She also does this ridiculously cute dance where she stands up on two and waves her front arms together when she wants attention. We\u0027d post a video, but like, we don\u0027t really need MORE people clicking on her because of the whole \"looooook at how cute she is I just CAN\u0027T!\". I\u0027m sure by now you\u0027re wondering what exactly Zoe\u0027s deal is. It\u0027s complicated, OKAY. Rest assured, Zoe\u0027s foster Dad will give you all the nitty-gritty specifics if you are brave enough to write him. Still not sure if you\u0027re the right fit? Well you definitely need to be cool, calm, and collected around little dogs, even little dogs like Zoe that don\u0027t like sharing anything and are very particular about where and when you touch them. Sounds fun, right!? All kidding aside, Zoe is beloved by her foster parents, and for that really special someone that can learn (and be taught by us!) how to patiently overcome these obstacles and live with Zoe\u0027s challenges, she will truly be worth it."

    "description": "Like the dog detective, Scooby is the perfect sidekick. Smart, loyal and a skilled detective! Plus he\u0027s a little on the goofy side. He will look at you with his head tilt and adoring eyes. He moves through life like a happy, gangly pre-teen with some pretty hilarious and uncoordinated moments. Scooby has a zest for life that just makes you happy to be around him. Whether he\u0027s throwing a toy in the air, splashing around in a plastic pool, batting his eyelashes in an attempt to charm treats out of you, or falling off the couch while focusing too hard on the toy he\u0027s playing with, he lives his life to the fullest! He loves to run, play fetch, tug of war with his favorite rope toy and sit in the water. After playing hard, he will go right into the plastic pool or mud hole of your choosing. He loves to be outside in the warm sunshine and has a favorite big rock he likes to sit on. When he\u0027s not on the rock, he loves to snuggle and sit in your lap. He loves his people and will show his love with lots of kisses, lean in\u0027s and snuggles and will even sit on your lap if you let him! Scooby has spent some time in a home where he was potty and crate trained. He also seemed playful and easygoing around cats. Scooby has learned some basic commands and is a smart guy who seems eager to learn more...because he\u0027ll do anything for a treat! Scooby is also in the Total Obedience Program. The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modelled after the AKC\u0027s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Scooby has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help him learn the skills to become the best dog he can be! He is learning skills like sit and down, walking nicely on leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers or other dogs, staying in a sit or down until told \"free,\" and coming when called. Once Scooby successfully completes all the skills on his training plan he will be considered TOP Dog Ready! Scooby is working hard to become a wonderful pet and as a part of APA\u0027s Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with Scooby after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA\u0027s CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https://vimeo.com/89434193 Once you meet this flirtatious, charming and playful young guy, you will be saying Scooby Dooby Doo -- I love you!!"

    "description": "What\u0027s black-and-white and cute all over? Major, that\u0027s who! This big, fluffy lug is APA\u0027s biggest heartthrob. With that gorgeous coat and handsome grin, it\u0027s no wonder why he has so many lady friends. It also helps that he\u0027s a generous kisser and a total love-bug. When he\u0027s really feeling the love, he\u0027ll plop right down on your lap like a poodle. And if you\u0027re really lucky, he\u0027ll lean backwards for a big ol\u0027 sloppy kiss! Needless to say, Major is not shy about showing his affection. Nothing makes him happier than belly rubs, back massages and nonstop doting. On date night, he\u0027ll take you out for a moonlit stroll around the park, where he loves to sniff all the scents and splish-splash in the lake. It\u0027s hard not to laugh when he flops down onto the grass and rolls around with his feet flailing in the air. To maintain his boyish good looks, Major chases balls in the play yard and walks around the ball fields at a steady clip. The \"working dog\" in him always yearns for excitement, so he requires enrichment from his human friends. Whether you\u0027re in the mood for hiking, swimming, couch cuddling, Major is ready to join in on the fun! When he\u0027s exploring the great outdoors, Major is busy working on his skills and has already mastered several commands. If you\u0027ve got treats, he\u0027ll show you his tricks. He makes excellent eye contact and is always willing to show off his smarts. Prepare to be amazed when you break out the puzzle toys! This beautiful boy is ready for the loving forever home he so deserves. Could it be with you? Please consider meeting him today and seeing how much he has to offer!"

    "description": "Do you like to hit the snooze button a few times in the morning? Oscar does too! This cutie is happy to cuddle in bed until the late morning. He will also politely lounge around the house once he does get up, maybe chewing on a nice bone or stuffed toy. Don\u0027t let his lazy, homebody attitude fool you though. He is more than happy to join his human for a nice long walk or jog. He also loves swimming and wading in any body of water he can find. At the shelter, Oscar spends his time playing fetch and and going for walks with his favorite volunteers. He has also had lots of behavior training and likes to show off his great leash manners. He spent some time in a foster home where he has proven his love for sleep and snuggling, and impressed his friends by being crate trained and house trained! Oscar bonds closely with his humans. He may be able to live with another well-matched pup, and he seems to prefer the company of lady dogs. His biggest dream is a yard with his very own kiddie pool! Oscar is affectionate, silly, smart and eager to please. He also happens to be extremely adorable. He cannot wait to be living it up with a family of his own, one that will be dedicated to help him keep perfecting his skills!"

Paloma loves attention and affection. She has a silly side too, and will showcase her signature play bow and occasionally break out into a case of the zoomies. Paloma is housebroken and doesn\u0027t need to be crated, although she is crate trained. She can be left alone for hours and won\u0027t even get on the furniture, if not invited. Her foster mom has reported her to be a perfect house guest. Paloma is such a gentle girl and loves to lean in for pets. She\u0027s got the softest fur, especially right under her chin! Paloma is happiest with her person. She especially loves her walks and being outdoors and will go at a slow and steady pace; she\u0027s excellent on a leash. Paloma has a cancerous lump on her leg. While it doesn\u0027t slow her down or impede her abilities at all, it has been deemed inoperable, though we are looking into other options. But she requires no medication and she has no special needs. And despite her condition, our girl still has spunk! Paloma deserves a wonderful home and hopes to find one where she will give and receive much love and affection. Follow Paloma\u0027s Instagram @Paloma_eats_her_vegetables"

    "description": "Transformation in the making!! Just a few months ago, Trent was living the good life in the shelter. But it was not what he needed one bit. He had energy for days and while he worked hard on his manners, the excitement of the shelter just never gave him a chance to relax. In-shelter Trent was exuberant and a little nutty, due to the stress of living in a kennel. Fast forward to today where he lives in a foster home and prefers naps over sprinting and snuggles over high energy toy playing. His foster reports they can rest their cereal bowl on his head while eating breakfast! What a difference a home environment makes! Trent loves his toys still but plays with them ever so gently, and most of the stuffing is still intact. He eats his meals out of a kong wobbler in his crate and snores the day away while his foster parents are at work. While in foster, Trent has grown accustomed to the crate and long, rambling walks around the apartment complex. Trent is a PRO at snuggling and will nose his way on to laps, couches and over your feet. Trent, of course, hasn\u0027t forgotten the lessons he learned at the shelter and knows sit, down, how to walk nicely on leash and is working on greeting visitors properly. He was cat tested within the shelter environment, with a cat safely enclosed in a large space and Trent on leash. He showed interest in the cat but softened and obeyed obedience commands; he never barked or pulled toward the cat. Based on the assessment, he has shown the possibility of living successfully with a cat with a firm training plan in place to fully integrate the animals over a long period of time. Trent is the sweetest boy that has almost completed his transformation from wild child to happy couch potato. Now he just needs his forever home!"

    "description": "Spanky is among the TOP ranks of APA\u0027s most disciplined, hard-working dogs! After months of work with his trainer, he mastered all the skills in his individualized training plan and is now a certified TOP (Total Obedience Program) Dog. In addition to his impressive repertoire of skills Spanky is a TOP dog in so many ways. We\u0027ll break it down for you like this: He\u0027s a TOP kisser. A hit with the ladies, Spanky is never one to shy away from PDA. He loves nothing more than to love up on his human friends and kiss and cuddle all day long. Essentially, he\u0027s a real-life teddy bear that will curl up with you in bed, offering the quiet comfort that only dogs can provide. He\u0027s a TOP dresser. Everyone at the shelter knows of Spanky\u0027s trademark look. He is rarely seen without a colorful neck tie. Always ready for a costume party, he even puts up with the most ridiculous pink, frilly ensembles. An entertainer at heart, Spanky loves to make people smile and laugh. He\u0027s a TOP decorator. Spanky is known as APA\u0027s resident interior designer. During his downtime, he keeps himself busy by redecorating his kennel with his bed and blankets. This little designer is so impressive, he even had a cameo on HGTV\u0027s House Hunters! Read all about it on our blog: https://www.austinpetsalive.org/2016/08/dont-miss-spankys-hgtv-debut-tune-into-house-hunters-on-aug-10/ He\u0027s a TOP entertainer. You never know what to expect when you peek inside his studio! It\u0027s always amusing when he\u0027s found wiggling under his blankets or crouched like a secret agent under his bed. Being the Southern gentleman that he is, Spanky always greets his guests with a toy in his mouth and a look in his soulful eyes that say, \"Want to play? Here\u0027s my favorite toy! He\u0027s a TOP leash walker. If you\u0027re looking for a dog that won\u0027t give you an arm workout, Spanky\u0027s your boy! He\u0027s easy breezy on his walks and prefers to cruise along at a slow and steady pace while taking intermittent sniffing breaks. He really just loves stopping at the bleachers for a long cuddle session. He\u0027s a TOP best friend. Being the theatrical extrovert that he is, Spanky just loves being around the people he loves and trusts. He can be a little shy at first, but once you win his trust, he will be your bestest friend for life and will make you feel like a rock star every day. He truly is a special, quirky, unique little boy with a larger-than-life personality! So what do you say? Could you be the TOP human in Spanky\u0027s life? He\u0027s looking for a pet-free, child-free home with minimal foot traffic. He likes quiet, peaceful environments and has no interest in dog parks, patio restaurants and other dog social scenes. More about the TOP Dog Program: The program is modelled after the AKC\u0027s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Spanky has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help him/her learn a number of skills including \"sit and \"down, walking nicely on leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers or other dogs, staying in a sit or down until told \"free,\" and coming when called. Now that Spanky successfully completed all the skills on his training plan, he is considered TOP Dog Ready! Check out a video on APA\u0027s CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https://vimeo.com/89434193 Follow Spanky\u0027s Instagram @adoptspanky"

    "description": "Dyson and Hoover are a bonded pair of siblings who came to their foster mom unable to walk. We don\u0027t know the exact cause, but their symptoms are similar to children with cerebral palsy. Dyson occasionally needs help changing his positions, but Hoover can move around by rolling and flipping. They both do very well in a large padded playpen and hey have a walker with a sling so they can change positions and interact with some of the other foster dogs. They eat a gruel mixture. Dyson can eat on his own but Hoover needs to be syringe fed. Dyson is also on a muscle relaxant to reduce his spasticity, but none of this affects their sweet disposition. Both boys love meeting people, their little tails wag so fast and they give puppy nuzzles and kisses. Dyson and Hoover must be adopted together. They will fuss and complain if one pup is picked up and the other one is not. But not to worry, they are so adorable people will be fighting over who gets to hold them! If they are placed on opposite sides in their spa"

    "description": "Dyson and Hoover are a bonded pair of siblings who came to their foster mom unable to walk. We don\u0027t know the exact cause, but their symptoms are similar to children with cerebral palsy. Dyson occasionally needs help changing his positions, but Hoover can move around by rolling and flipping. They both do very well in a large padded playpen and hey have a walker with a sling so they can change positions and interact with some of the other foster dogs. They eat a gruel mixture. Dyson can eat on his own but Hoover needs to be syringe fed. Dyson is also on a muscle relaxant to reduce his spasticity, but none of this affects their sweet disposition. Both boys love meeting people, their little tails wag so fast and they give puppy nuzzles and kisses. Dyson and Hoover must be adopted together. They will fuss and complain if one pup is picked up and the other one is not. But not to worry, they are so adorable people will be fighting over who gets to hold them! If they are placed on opposite sides in their space, Hoover will complain and roll/flip/move to get close to Dyson. They can get really rowdy and vocal when they play together which is just the cutest thing to see. Can you open your home and your heart for this special pair of pups?"

    "description": "Tito is a very friendly little guy who gets along famously with his nine foster siblings. Nothing slows him down - he has as much energy as dogs half his age, if not more! He eats in his crate to keep him from getting extra grub from his paw-mates\u0027 food bowls. He also believes any and all treats were meant for his royal self, but he is getting better with his manners. Tito is a real goofball and will make you laugh with his silly antics and seems to go out of his way to brighten up your day. His mind is always going going going and you can tell he is very aware of his surroundings and likes to check everything out. Tito freely gives his love to everyone, but especially to those he bonds with and he\u0027s a real snuggle bug. Everything he does is cute, from the way he curls up in his bed to the way he gently paws at his face when he\u0027s sleepy. His favorite thing - other than food - is his curling up in his bed and blanket and he is OK with sharing it with his foster brother. He seems to be new to playtime, but he has discovered a fun little game of chase with one of his foster siblings who will engage others to play with him. Tito has congestive heart failure, so he will require medication along with frequent potty breaks. It\u0027s hard to believe he has any medical issues with his outgoing and lively personality. A home with access to a yard and another playful pup is all Tito needs to thrive. But don\u0027t take our word for it, go visit Tito in his foster home and fall in love with him today!"

    "description": "Benny, oh, Benny! This sweet dog didn\u0027t come from the best beginnings, as he was abandoned on a property when his owners moved away. He was fed by neighbors until one day he escaped the yard and ended up at the city shelter. Next stop: Austin Pets Alive! Due to his auspicious beginnings, Benny hasn\u0027t had much practice just being a dog, but the team at APA! is working to change that!! He doesn\u0027t see very well but can sniff out treats like a champ! He\u0027s already learned sit, as it earns him the most cookies. With the hard work of the behavior team, Benny is learning that moving cars just aren\u0027t that scary and how to walk like a proper gentleman on leash. While he hasn\u0027t perfected his dog manners, he\u0027s already come just a long way! Benny is a silly boy who likes those romps in the yard - and then he\u0027s a big fan of naps. Toys weren\u0027t in his repetoire before he found himself at APA!, so don\u0027t be surprised if this special dog mistakes a rock for a ball! With patience and love, Benny will you show how deserving he is of his very own forever home. We can\u0027t wait to see his transformation!"

    "description": "This handsome, tall drink of water is Rio! His interests are fetch, swimming, fetch, treats, fetch, and gently leaning into your leg for pets. I should also mention that he loves playing fetch, and he\u0027s great about bringing the ball back to you and dropping it. If he thinks you don\u0027t see the ball on the ground, he\u0027ll politely pick it up and set it in your lap, so Rio manages to enjoy fetch with even the laziest of tennis ball throwers. True to his name, Rio also really LOVES being in the water! Whether you\u0027re hosing him off or letting him take a dip in a pool or creek, he\u0027ll take all the water he can find please. Rio may be a big guy, but he is very easy to walk on leash. He loves walking outside to gently take in all the sights and smells around him...always walking by your side at a nice pace. He\u0027s a smart guy who sits politely for treats and appears housebroken. Rio is just a quiet, content soul who enjoys being with his person. He\u0027s an easy friend who would love it if you threw him a tennis ball or took him to swim, but he\u0027d also like a nice quiet walk around the neighborhood. Come meet this handsome guy today!"

    "description": "We don\u0027t know much about Lady Red\u0027s past, but we are certain that her future is sunny, with a 100% chance of a forever family. Lady Red currently resides in a very special and loving foster home, where she has proven over and over how perfect she is. As a low maintenance gal, who is house and crate trained and who loves nothing more than to meet and greet new people with her striking beauty and soft manners, she\u0027d be a good addition to most families. Just like us humans, our beautiful Lady comes with some quirks. She is partially blind, possibly due to having Canine Diabetes. This is a chronic disease that is very easily managed by having her on a controlled glucose (sugar) dog food, as well as insulin shots. Lady Red knows this quick shot is part of her daily health routine so administering her medication is very simple. This beauty is so intuitive, that it took her close to nothing to memorize her foster home and breeze through it with no problems, regardless of her visual impairment. On a recent interview, Lady Red confessed that her favorite activities are car rides and napping under the sun, as they make her feel warm and fuzzy feelings. She absolutely loves the feeling of soft wind and the shiny sun on her sweet face, and she can often be seen around town walking and exploring with her foster family. She has good leash manners and is learning basic commands. Lady Red has come a long way to find her place in this world. If you\u0027d like to walk this earth right next to her, don\u0027t delay! She\u0027ll be waiting patiently."

    "description": "Zydeco is an athletic, energetic, fun-loving pal! This smart, eager-to-please guy does very well on walks and runs, and is incredibly alert to his surroundings. If he had his way, he\u0027d catch every bird and squirrel he sees, and is thrilled to sniff around in the great outdoors! If you ask him if he wants to go for a run, he\u0027ll eagerly answer yes with sweet affectionate kisses! He adores his people, and is very affectionate to anyone he recognizes. It\u0027s a very rewarding feeling to win his love! He really is the epitome of the ultimate loyal best friend. He loves to be out of his kennel, as he doesn\u0027t like it when the other dogs bark at him when he goes in and out. He just wants his space to bask in the sun! Zydeco would make a perfect jogging buddy! He\u0027d also love to join a family that would include him on their outings and adventures. He has so much love to give his perfect family, and can\u0027t wait to cover them in kisses! Come meet this sweet, playful muscle man, Zydeco!"

Rustler is a handsome, healthy young adult who would love to settle in with a family where this fun dog will put a smile on everyone\u0027s face. Rustler is overall a pretty chill guy but he\u0027s ready for anything - a long walk or run, hanging out in the yard or even just some couch surfing. He doesn\u0027t need much and doesn\u0027t have an overly energetic demeanor that needs constant attention. He\u0027s just a cool guy who\u0027s very affectionate and loves to be with his people. He\u0027s got an ever-present bounce in his step that reflects his sunny outlook and just wants to be everyone\u0027s friend. Rustler is fantastic on a leash and doesn\u0027t get distracted by other people or dogs, as he keeps his focus on his walking partner. He is extremely obedient and behaves very well without a lot of management. He\u0027s lived in home before so he knows to follow the rules. Rustler also enjoys learning new things and is in the Total Obedience Program. The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modelled after the AKC\u0027s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Rustler has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help him learn the skills to become the best dog he can be! He is learning skills like sit and down, walking nicely on leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers or other dogs, staying in a sit or down until told \"free,\" and coming when called. Once Rustler successfully completes all the skills on his training plan he will be considered TOP Dog Ready! Rustler is working hard to become a wonderful pet, and as a part of APA\u0027s Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with him after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA\u0027s CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https://vimeo.com/89434193. Rustler\u0027s looking for a home where he can get some cuddle time and a soft place to lay his brindle head. Come meet him and see if he\u0027s right for yours!"

She loves snuggling, getting to play in the yard, or taking a leisurely walk around the neighborhood. Her energy level is perfect and matches her surroundings. If it\u0027s time to run, she\u0027s a great running buddy, but if it\u0027s time to stop and smell the roses, she\u0027s good with that too. If you act like it\u0027s time to play a game of chase, she\u0027ll zoomie around the room with you until it\u0027s time to relax on the couch. Sandy also LOVES to swim or splash around in the water, so if you enjoy the water - or enjoy watching a dog splash around with glee, then you need to meet Sandy. She has experience in a home, is housebroken, and has lived peacefully with cats! This beauty also has brains - she knows the sit, down, and shake commands. Come meet the beautiful and spunky Sandy today!"

She and her sister came to APA pretty confused and timid, but it didn\u0027t take this little love bug long to open up and show the world just how friendly she is! Highly affectionate is an understatement with this sweet girl. She loves cuddling with her people, and getting pets. She\u0027s adorably happy and wiggly with joy, and is incredibly generous with her kisses. The APA volunteers rave about her vivacious happy tail wag that she\u0027ll get when she sees a friend approaching. It\u0027s absolutely precious! Ellie is very sweet-natured, and enjoys her canine play groups, and also likes kids. She knows to sit for treats, and is awesome on her easy walk harness. She is a big fan of going for walks and jogs, but is equally as thrilled to lounge with her people around the house. Ellie enjoys learning new things and is in the Total Obedience Program. The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modeled after the AKC\u0027s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test.

Traveler likes to nap on the couch while his people watch TV. This cutie also enjoys grabbing a plush toy and energetically throwing it around. He\u0027s generally calm, but will run zoomies around the yard. This sweetie doesn\u0027t mind being left alone. He\u0027s good in a crate and can entertain himself, especially if he has a chewy to occupy him Traveler can happily live with respectful dogs. He\u0027ll give kisses to and run around with well-matched dogs. He seems neutral with cats: he\u0027s curious about them, but doesn\u0027t want to bother them, so that match may be a possibility. Traveler is seeking an adopter with time for all his loving; is it yours?"

She is calm and quiet in the crate, and if the door is left open, she will enter it voluntarily to lay down, relax and play with her toys. She makes herself at home very quickly and seems confident and relaxed. She is an expert cuddler and is happy to \"Netflix and chill, snuggled up to her person for hours-as long as she gets a run in! This loyal, lovely lady will make a wonderful addition to an active home with an adopters who can give her the training and opportunity to really shine. Stella has so much love to share, and she can\u0027t wait to show you just how much!"

    "description": "We\u0027re not going to leave out the best part - we\u0027re here to mention the bisque! Bisque is a low-key, but fun young adult. Bisque has lost his sight, but isn\u0027t let blindness get in the way of enjoying life. He is a goofy, playful dog who loves being around people. He\u0027s been spending time in an APA! foster home, and has shown us that he will make a fun companion. Losing his eyesight must have sharpened Bisque\u0027s hearing. He loves to hear praise and his favorite people\u0027s voices, and he\u0027ll respond quickly. He\u0027s not a super-affectionate dog, but he does enjoy some occasional petting and head-scratching. Bisque will need a patient family who can help him get used to his new environment. It will take him a bit of time to adjust to his new surroundings and learn his way around. But once he does, he\u0027s got a low-stress, casual attitude towards life that lets him enjoy his daily routine. Bisque has a lower energy level, so he doesn\u0027t need a great deal of stimulation during the day. He enjoys some outside time so that he can sniff around and explore, but he doesn\u0027t need heavy-duty exercise. Bisque would probably best enjoy a quieter, low-energy home. Concerned about his blindness? Once he gets used to your home\u0027s layout his needs won\u0027t be much different than any other dog. Bisque would love to meet you and share his carefree approach to life! And remember that when you adopt, you\u0027ll also be helping another dog who can his place in our program."

    "description": "Frodo is a party animal. He loves to have a good time, all the time. He\u0027s also super smart and very sweet, so if you consider yourself more of an extrovert, you may have found an excellent wingman in Frodo. Frodo will play with you all day if you let him. He especially loves to play with lacrosse balls, and enjoys showing up the high school team by making an occasional interception. He also loves being loved on, and gives lots of love in return. The most adorable thing about him is his one eyebrow. He is a very expressive dog anyways. You won\u0027t ever struggle to know how Frodo is feeling, but his eyebrow puts him over the top. Frodo is house trained, walks pretty well on a leash, and is well-mannered when left alone in the house. He is very treat motivated, and will do just about anything for a snack. In fact, Frodo is in APA\u0027s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) program and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week toward the goal of passing the American Kennel Club\u0027s CGC test! Frodo has been working hard to be a dog you can take anywhere with pride. To pass the CGC test, a dog must demonstrate obedience and general reliability in real world situations. Dogs in APA\u0027s CGC program learn to sit and down, walk nicely on leash, sit calmly when approached by strangers or another dog, won\u0027t approach people or dogs without permission, greet people appropriately, stay in a sit or down until told and come when called. As part of APA\u0027s CGC program you can work with APA to continue to build a training relationship with Frodo after adoption and get officially CGC certified for free!

    "description": "Tank Girl might look like a bruiser, but she\u0027s really just a goof ball at heart. All she wants to do is give you lots of love and affection. If you are a big cuddler who likes walks and has a few rawhide bones to spare, Tank Girl will love you forever. Tank Girl learns something new everyday! With the exception of spotting a squirrel, Tank Girl walks well on leash and knows sit and down. Tank Girl is overwhelmed with love with her person and has a hard time being alone. She really does not like being in a crate, but she will sleep soundly through the night at the foot of your bed if you let her. She is pretty hilarious when she sleeps. She prefers to nap with all four legs sticking straight in the air. Which may explain why she hates the crate; it\u0027s just cramping her style. She prefers curling up on her own blanket to relax. Tank Girl has never met a friend she didn\u0027t like! On a recent sleepover, she greeted everyone politely and quickly requested belly rubs. She might give a gentle nose if she isn\u0027t done with being petted, but she isn\u0027t at all insistent. Do you have a dog friendly work place? Because Tank Girl knows how put in data, gossip at the water cooler and tell you when it\u0027s lunch time. And she won\u0027t have to be at home alone! We are also happy to assist with obedience training at APA! She\u0027s naturally very respectful in the home. No jumping where she shouldn\u0027t be or chewing what isn\u0027t hers. She really loves walks, so a family that can do that with her once a day would be ideal. And she would prefer a house with lots of laps to lay in. She is a dog of many cuddles. If you are looking for some big love from a big girl, Tank Girl would suit you well."

    "description": "We couldn\u0027t think of a more fitting name for Twister because once you meet him, you\u0027ll get caught up in a whirlwind of love! This sweet boy will happily sit quietly by your side and lend a listening ear. It\u0027s hard not to fall in love when you look into those soulful brown eyes that say, \"Come sit down with me and tell me all about your day.\" Want to play? Well, Twister is also a puppy at heart! His joy is contagious when he\u0027s chasing after balls or playing tug with his rope toy. Always up for fun and games, he will sweep you up into a spin of laughs for hours on end. Just as good as with play, Twister likes to work his brain. Like a cat, he\u0027s curious of his surroundings and loves to be in the middle of things. Pop the trunk and he\u0027ll jump right in with a look on his face that says, \"That\u0027s what you wanted me to do, right?\" He loves getting outside and inspecting every bush - and if there\u0027s a water source nearby, he\u0027ll dive right in! Twister enjoys learning new things and is in the Total Obedience Program. The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modeled after the AKC\u0027s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Twister as a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help him learn the skills to become the best dog she can be! Currently, he knows the commands \u0027sit\u0027, \u0027down\u0027, \u0027shake\u0027, \u0027come\u0027 and \u0027stay\u0027. Did I hear you say wow!? He is learning skills walking nicely on leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers or other dogs, staying in a sit or down until told \"free,\" as well as \u0027place\u0027 (running-to and staying-in a designated spot) and coming when called. Once Twister successfully completes all the skills on her training plan he will be considered TOP Dog Ready! Twister is working hard to become a wonderful pet and as a part of APA\u0027s Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with Twister after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA\u0027s CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https://vimeo.com/89434193 Twister invites you to come on down and fall for him at first sight!"

She\u0027s also a play group rock star who loves to play with other dogs. Olive is sweet and quiet in her kennel, even when the dogs around her are barking their heads off. Her kennel is always clean too, so she appears to be house trained and she quietly and patiently waits her turn to be walked. Once she gets to know you, she\u0027s a happy and loving girl without being pushy about it. Olive would love to have a person or family to play ball with her and show her what real love is.

He plays fetch like a Boss(Man) and can chillax like no one\u0027s business. He has a great set of basic obedience skills -- knows sit and down, waits nicely at doors, won\u0027t pester you while you eat, and of course he\u0027s house-trained. Do you need a companion while you work? This Boss is your Man. His foster mom takes him to her office each day where he relaxes on his dog bed and doesn\u0027t seem to mind being doted on by the office staff. (It\u0027s a \"ruff life but somedog\u0027s gotta do it.) When he\u0027s not by your side, you can probably find him snuggled under a blanket. His foster mom says he loves being tucked in tight. Boss Man loves humans and quickly builds a loyal bond. He\u0027d love to have a quiet backyard where he can play with his human friends. Boss Man has had a few rough years resulting in some mild arthritis in his legs. While he loves a good game of fetch, he has some days where he just needs to lay low. We\u0027ll let you in on a little secret, Boss Man would really rather NOT be the Boss. He\u0027ll happily leave that job to you. (NOTE: Boss Man must be adopted out to a home with a backyard.)"

    "description": "From Duke\u0027s temporary foster during Hurricane Harvey: \"He has been so wonderful. He has such a sweet heart and is so gentle. He is the biggest cuddler and really loves hugs \u0026 kisses. I live alone, and we did not have much interaction with other kids or cats. However with the few dogs that we did run into, he was patient and let them sniff him. Duke is house \u0026 crate trained. He whines to let you know he needs to go out. He can keep himself entertained with toys. He has medium to high energy level. I really hope he finds a great home because he is the sweetest dog.\" Duke, or Dukelberry as he\u0027s known by his friends, is one of those dogs who exudes coolness. He\u0027s a happy guy who is content to go with the flow; this translates to being really easy to walk on leash and well behaved if you\u0027re out on a patio or walking a trail. Duke has already lived in a home, so we know he\u0027s housebroken and crate trained. He knows the \u0027sit\u0027 and \u0027down\u0027 commands and seems to pick up on skills quickly. He loves treats, so he would make a great training candidate if you\u0027re looking to teach him new things. Duke has a great energy level - he enjoys playing and having fun, but he\u0027s relaxed and chill when it\u0027s not playtime. He will lean in gently and sneak you kisses as a thank you for being his friend too. Do you want a relaxed, fun, easy-to-walk, housebroken dog? Come meet the Duke of APA today!"

    "description": "If you are ready for a fabulous day then meet your new loyal buddy, Gisele! Gisele is equal parts active and loving. She would love to spend all day outside on a walk, followed by tug of war and fetch. She likes playing with plush toys, enjoys relaxing by snuggling up next to you so you can shower her with lots of attention and petting. She will settle down in her own space, but prefers being near you. Gisele is very alert and excitable. She will bark to let you know any time a person or animal (including squirrels) approaches your yard or door. She is successful with basic commands and is quick to recognize/respect routines. She is excellent with her crate and goes in easily with a small treat prompt. Gisele is an enthusiastic member of the family. She is smart, wants to please and has endless amount of energy and love to share. Within moments, Gisele will steal your heart with her beautiful face, curious looks, spirited personality and loving manner (after she greets you with a series of loud barks). If you have the time, energy and heart to commit to this sweet, playful dog then get ready for a truly fabulous new member of your family!"

    "description": "Elvis will play his way into your heart. He loves squeaky toys, balls, and his favorite is tug of war! One may think that a senior dog would not be as energetic and eager to play, but Elvis has broken the mold. He is active and loves the outdoors, so Elvis enjoys taking walks with his owner and exploring. He loves to be with his people, yet Elvis can be independent. He is content playing with his toys alone and can be left by himself at home, but when his humans come home, Elvis is the perfect companion. This dog will follow you from room to room because he loves his humans and simply wants to be near them. As trust builds up, Elvis\u0027s sweet personality shines through and his loyal self is all yours! He is the perfect combination of loving, curious, smart, and playful. Elvis is the perfect dog for someone who wants a companion and enjoys having the best of both worlds: a mature dog, with the heart of a young pup."

    "description": "You won\u0027t get too much bucking from this Bronco! Bronco is a sweet young adult who should make a great long-term companion for a lucky family. Bronco has spent time living in a home before, so he knows his way around the house and should be able to make a quick transition to his new home. He walks well on a leash, knows his basic commands, and has shown no sign of being destructive when he spends some time alone in the house. He can be a bit shy when first meeting new people, but give Bronco a chance to warm up and his silly, affectionate personality will soon show itself. He loves nothing better than a good belly rub. He\u0027s also an expert at chasing a tennis ball. Returning the ball? Well he could use some work on that. But he\u0027ll have great fun trying to play keep away from his family! Bronco has lived with dogs and kids in the past, and wouldn\u0027t mind sharing a home with them again. But he seems to be a versatile dog who could succeed in a variety of home environments. Hopefully it will be yours! And don\u0027t forget that when you adopt from APA!, you\u0027re helping two dogs - the one you\u0027re welcoming into your home, and the one who will be able to join our program."

This boy doesn\u0027t let anything get him down, and if you\u0027re ever feeling down, he will definitely lift your spirits just by being around him. Spike loves when you\u0027re sitting in a chair, so he can back up into you for petting and scratching optimization. His fur is so soft that you won\u0027t mind. If you choose the floor, he\u0027ll wiggle all the way up to you to get closer. The best of all, though, is if you throw him a tennis ball or toy...you can just see his eyes light up with excitement. Spike has also never met a squeaky toy he didn\u0027t like. Spike is a smart guy who appears housebroken and already knows sit and down. He loves treats, so we think he would be a great student for anything else you want to teach him. I think most of all, though, he\u0027s just so fun to be around! He is guaranteed to make you smile and laugh with his goofy antics. Come meet Spike at APA today and let his contagious joie de vivre make your day brighter!"

    "description": "Davey is a bouncy boy who gives off great vibes that say he wants to play with his new human friends - especially if they\u0027ll throw those balls he wants to fetch! And if the tennis ball is replaced with a treat, he\u0027s even happier. This handsome, healthy dude has such a bright, sweet disposition and he\u0027s so much fun to be around that he\u0027s ready to liven up anyone\u0027s adventures. And he appears to be crate and house trained, so he\u0027ll be a wonderful couch companion, too. Davey enjoys learning new things. He is in APA\u0027s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) program and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week toward the goal of passing the American Kennel Club\u0027s CGC test! Davey has been working hard to be a dog you can take anywhere with pride. To pass the CGC test, a dog must demonstrate obedience and general reliability in real world situations. Dogs in APA\u0027s CGC program learn to sit and down, walk nicely on leash, sit calmly when approached by strangers or another dog, won\u0027t approach people or dogs without permission, greet people appropriately, stay in a sit or down until told \"free,\" and come when called. As part of APA\u0027s CGC program you can work with APA to continue to build a training relationship with Davey after adoption and get officially CGC certified for free! Check out a video about CGC: https://vimeo.com/89434193 Come meet this boy and see if he\u0027s perfect for your home."

    "description": "Here are some things that are awesome about Dennis. He is house trained, knows sit, and \"bring it here\" when playing fetch. He is also hilarious; he makes all kinds of funny noises and gestures, and looks like some kind of goofy bunny-velociraptor hybrid when he is chasing balls, which is often. He is good at entertaining himself. He is very loving and loyal. When he considers you his person, you will be everything to him; he loves to be near you and to get belly rubs. While Dennis would love to have space to stretch his legs in a yard, he also wouldn\u0027t mind living a homebody life in an apartment. He\u0027s got a decent amount of energy for a mature, 8 year old gentleman. Dennis is looking for a best friend that shows him the world and helps him see the good in humans. In return, this handsome devil will give you all the love you can handle."

Take him out for a visit and you\u0027ll see that Tugg is the whole package-highly skilled, a good boy in the home, and super athletic! Here at the shelter, Tugg has become quite popular with the volunteers. His friends often remark on how well-mannered he is on the leash. In fact, he has become the go-to dog for behavioral training sessions. Always eager to please, he is happy to show off his many skills. His sleepover friend reported that he\u0027s the perfect gentleman in the home. He waits to be invited on the bed and will only chew and tug on his toys. He also shows great potential in being crate trained. Tugg has so many great qualities, but anyone who knows him will tell you that he is the shelter\u0027s most talented fetch player! It\u0027s hard not to laugh when he breaks out into full-body wiggles at the sight of a tennis ball. His happiness is contagious when he\u0027s playing his favorite sport. And when playtime is over, he\u0027s ready for a long snuggle session on the couch. If that\u0027s not reason enough to take him home, look at that sweet baby seal face! He has a way of tugging people toward him with those soulful eyes. Don\u0027t resist the tug and visit with him today!"

    "description": "Meet Faraon; this honorable gentleman is loyal, loving, curious, and very attentive! Much like a Boy Scout, our Faraon enjoys being apart of a family-pack while going on adventures. Exploring with him is easy; he\u0027s great on a leash, responds when called, and enjoys carrying supplies for the team (e.g water, snacks, etc.). His intelligence, eagerness to please, and sweet-tooth have made him easy to train. Not only does Faraon know basic commands such as \"Sit, \"Down, \"Stay, \"Relax; but also \"Home, \"Heel, \"Spin, and \"Touch\"! This boy\u0027s insatiable appetite for learning makes training easy \u0026 enjoyable for everyone involved. After a day of moderate physical and/or mental exercise, Faraon likes to relax within the home - often you will find him on the carpet or in his crate, but never on furniture. His respect for household objects would make anyone proud - this dog hasn\u0027t shown any destructive tendencies and is fully house-broken. Faraon is a model pup that would love nothing more than to be your one and only. Would you give him a chance?"

This gentle giant has has a few years on him and his back legs are a little wobbly, but after years of dealing with Storm Troopers its to be expected. He has enjoyed some water therapy in Lady Bird Lake and would really appreciate the opportunity to continue adventures either at the lake or possibly a pool with supervision. He can be easily entertained by most fluffy objects and probably would enjoy a new light saber as what would he be without one? Hans Solo will be a loyal friend by your side and may the force be with you! Inquire about him as he\u0027s out of this world!"

It\u0027s hard to choose a word other than \"perfect to describe this girl who is equal parts spunky and sweet! May is quite the athlete and loves fetching and water - and especially loves when these two are combined. She\u0027s been known to stick her whole head underwater to retrieve a ball. As much fun as she is to play with, she is also very well-behaved in a home. She is housebroken, calm, and respectful of human items and food. She is content to snuggle with you or lay by your feet as you watch TV. May knows \u0027sit\u0027 and walks well on leash. She would make a great hiking partner. She also seems to learn quickly and loves food, so we think she would make a great training student. Aside from her skills, she\u0027s just a doll and a delight to be around. She has the biggest, brightest smile and is so much fun! Come visit her at APA today."

    "description": "Clark is a sweet and mellow gentleman. He loves his human friends and is eager to please. He has a cute way to communicate \"I love you with wiggles and sounds when his friends walk by. Clark plays it cool and isn\u0027t a needy guy at all. He\u0027s house trained and can just chill by himself, looking out the window or hanging out on the patio, or he can spend a whole day cuddling next to you on the couch. But don\u0027t let his quiet demeanor deceive you. Clark is also up for an adventure! He\u0027s on the Rufftail Running team and is happy for long walks or jogs - whatever his human is into! He is very easy to handle on a leash, knows his commands and stays in touch through eye contact. The ideal family for Clark will make sure to keep him somewhat active, but more importantly will make time to spend with him around the house. He loves to be in your lap on your couch, but is smart enough to realize that he needs to get your permission first. We call him McDreamy because he looks deep into your eyes and you want to tell him your secrets. Whether you live in an apartment or house, Clark will be your faithful bestie from the moment you give him the opportunity of a forever home. Follow Clark on Instagram @clark.the.lapdog https://www.instagram.com/clark.the.lapdog/?hl\u003den"

    "description": "From Gracie\u0027s foster: \"Gracie is the sweetest dog and loves to snuggle. She\u0027ll come sit right next to me (or partially on me) at the end of a long day. She loves to run around in the backyard and play fetch. When we first took her home she jumped up a lot and now she\u0027s mellowed out and is minding her manners. She loves one of her baby stuffed animals so much she ripped the arms and legs off of him and still carries him (and sometimes the arms/legs too). Every morning she sits on the rug (one of her \"places\") and watches us leave for the day.\" Gracie is an Austinite through and through. She loves staying active in any way possible: walking the neighborhood, jogging by your bike, swimming in the lake, or hiking the trails. She\u0027s also a fetch master and tug enthusiast. Between her leash skills and love of people, she makes a great companion for food truck dining and coffee shop patios. After a run or a swim or a game of fetch, she\u0027s more than happy to snuggle up with you and shower you with kisses. This intelligent, affectionate pup is always eager to learn new tricks (especially if there are treats in it for her) and is in the Total Obedience Program. The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modelled after the AKC\u0027s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Gracie has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help her learn the skills to become the best dog she can be! She is learning skills like sit and down, walking nicely on leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers or other dogs, staying in a sit or down until told \"free,\" and coming when called. Once Gracie successfully completes all the skills on his/her training plan he/she will be considered TOP Dog Ready! Gracie is working hard to become a wonderful pet and as a part of APA\u0027s Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with Gracie after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA\u0027s CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https://vimeo.com/89434193"

    "description": "Porter is a congenial gentleman who loves affection and enjoys very much being part of the family. He doesn\u0027t constantly demand attention, but he will gently lay his head on your lap from time to time, to let you know he\u0027s there should you be in the mood for some cuddling. If invited, he LOVES to play couch potato. He wants to make his human friends happy. If you want to cuddle, he would love to cuddle with you. If you invite him to join you on the couch, he would love to do that, too. But if you want some private time, he\u0027ll go entertain himself. Or take a snooze. A calm, quiet and easygoing boy, Porter loves going for strolls with his human friends and does well on his leash. He\u0027s a smart pup who answers to the \u0027sit,\u0027 \u0027down,\u0027 \u0027stay,\u0027 \u0027wait,\u0027 \u0027drop it,\u0027 \u0027off,\u0027 \u0027come\u0027 and \u0027shake\u0027 commands. And he\u0027s crate and house-trained. On his sleepovers, he enjoys rolling in the backyard grass and doing some zoomies before putting his head in his person\u0027s lap for some extra petting. He\u0027s happy to lounge about inside and out. Porter is a loyal, affectionate boy who\u0027s looking for a calm home with a fenced yard to explore and squirrels to watch. One with space to stretch out in for a nap would be ideal. If that sounds like your home, come meet this boy today!"

    "description": "Minka embodies everything that is good and pure about a dog. In a word, she is resilient. The wounds from her rough past are visible on her skin, but her effervescent spirit shines through when she flashes that gorgeous smile and breaks out into full-body wiggles. This sweet girl has never met a stranger. Everyone who walks by her kennel door is a potential new best friend. Stop and give her a pet and she\u0027ll reward you with kisses and cuddles. It\u0027s always amusing when she flops over for belly rubs and wiggles around with her stubby legs up in the air. She may be missing an ear, but that won\u0027t stop her from living life to its fullest. She loves getting out and sniffing new scents. She\u0027s great on the leash and is more than happy to join you on a leisurely stroll. Her favorite activity, however, is snuggling. Nothing makes her happier than canoodling with her human friends on the couch, snorting and snuffling in delight! Minka has so much potential to make her forever family very happy for many years to come. So what do you say? Are you ready to give Minka the loving home she so deserves? Please consider meeting her today! Follow Minka\u0027s Instagram @adoptminka"

    "description": "Julio is a puppy in an adult dog\u0027s body, in the best of the ways. He looks and acts like that goofy, lanky teenager we all know and love. Julio is always up for a party, and he lives life to the fullest, whether that\u0027s romping around the yard, chasing a toy, or tricking you into giving him all your treats. Julio is all about those treats! He knows sit, down, shake (he\u0027s ambidextrous!), stay, and come. He will do anything for food, so there\u0027s probably no end to what you could teach him! Julio is also already housebroken. He would probably enjoy an active home where playing and fun are the name of the game. Julio is just one of the happiest dogs you\u0027ll meet; he has this big, goofy grin that seems to say, \"Hey guys! What are we doing next?! His zest for life is absolutely contagious. And have you seen the guy? He is so handsome! However, he doesn\u0027t let his looks get to his head, and will greet you with his tongue hanging out of that big, adorable, goofy grin. Come meet our favorite good lookin, goofball today."

    "description": "Thor is your guy if you enjoy the one to one of having an \"only\" dog. He is a dog whose supreme wish is a home of his own without other doggie siblings. He hasn\u0027t been observed with cats or children. Thor is said to be eager and silly. He\u0027s eager to learn, that\u0027s for sure. He\u0027s a dream on a leash and loves jaunting around the ball fields. If you want a goofy snuggler, Thor is going to fill that bill. When you meet him at the shelter he will seem on high alert, but once away from the shelter environment, snuggler deluxe and best friend are his MO. And he loves his treats, so is quite motivated for lessons and to learn. Thor seems to listen totally, with his ears showing he is paying attention. They will move to the top of his head when he\u0027s listening, and the tiniest flop over of the ears lets you know he\u0027s paying full attention. Isn\u0027t that cute? Thor would love to be your only four-legged friend, so please come meet him and give him the home in which he will thrive for all time. And remember, all APA adoptions come with free behavior assistance through APA\u0027s behavior team. In addition to all of Thor\u0027s wonderful natural qualities, he has been working hard to be a dog you can take anywhere with pride. Thor has been working on his Canine Good Citizen skills with APA staff and volunteers. To pass the American Kennel Club\u0027s CGC test (and be considered CGC-ready by APA), a dog must demonstrate obedience and general reliability in real world situations. An APA CGC-ready dog knows sit and down, walks nicely on leash, will sit calmly when you are approached by strangers or another dog, won\u0027t approach people or dogs without permission, stays in sit or down until told \"free,\" and comes when called. This training is very connected to your dog\u0027s relationship with you, so regardless of where Thor is in this training program at the time of adoption, APA will work with you to help you establish this relationship and keep the training going. Check out a video about CGC: http://player.vimeo.com/video/89434193"

    "description": "Wyatt is a sensitive soul who spent most of his life in a backyard. Now at the shelter, he\u0027s content to cuddle the day away with his human friends. He may be a big boy, but that doesn\u0027t stop him from climbing right into their laps to get some good pets. This sweet, affectionate pup is a smartie, too. He\u0027s happy to work and learns new tricks quickly, answering to the \u0027sit\u0027 command and walking well on leash. And he\u0027s crate and house-trained! Wyatt is a medium energy pup and may do well with a well-matched doggie companion, but he\u0027s really just looking for a home with humans who he can cuddle with. Come meet him and see if he\u0027s right for yours."

    "description": "Hello! Do you want cute, spritely and smart as a whip when you adopt a dog? Then you came to the right place! Farrah is a bundle of fun, rolled up in a treat-motivated body that is always ready for the next adventure. This young boxer mix weighs all of 40 pounds, so she\u0027s a perfect size for just about any household. Farrah thinks learning new tricks is the absolute bee\u0027s knees. She\u0027s got an A+ sit and a solid B in leash walking. She is one of our TOP (Total Obedience Program) dogs, so she\u0027s also working on skills like coming when called, down and place. Though some might think that a 40-pound dog might not fit on their lap, Farrah is here to tell you different. She finds just the right amount of curled up and sprawled out to make sure your lap is never cold. She has a heart murmur, but it doesn\u0027t slow her down. Her spunky little attitude will always cheer you up. And kisses are absolutely included. The shelter is a pretty chaotic place for Farrah, so don\u0027t judge dogs by their kennel behavior. Farrah is home ready and knows the fine art of sleeping on soft beds and being a lovely companion."

This energetic, affectionate boy came from a home with a disabled owner who was unable to give him attention and proper care. He was mostly left alone in a yard to entertain himself. Today Beryl is delighted to be learning what\u0027s it\u0027s like to be taken on walks, what playing fetch means and what toys are for. And most of all, he loves cuddling and belly rubs! He wants to follow his new human friends everywhere, sitting quietly at their feet getting head rubs, and then flipping over for those belly scratches. Beryl aspires to love and be loved by a companion who can continue to introduce him to new life experiences and give him the exercise he\u0027s lacked until now. Come take this boy for a walk and glow in that beautiful smile."

    "description": "Yancey is a sweet, mild-mannered lady who would love nothing more than to be your friend and playmate. She may seem aloof when you initially meet her but the more time you spend with her, the more you get to see her fun, winsome personality come out. You can always tell when Yancey sees her favorite people. Every time they walk through the door, she\u0027ll twirl in a circle and hop in excitement. It\u0027s the cutest! She loves car rides and quietly sits, checking out the view through the window. She\u0027s all about the journey and the destination. Especially if the road leads to Starbucks for some yummy puppy whip. Yancey is house-trained and does well in her crate. She enjoys a good run or jog, often going for 4 miles around the trail. She\u0027ll adjust her speed to yours so if you want to go for a leisurely stroll, Yancey is game. Her favorite thing to do afterwards is to cozy up for cuddles, kisses, maybe a treat or two. If you want to stay in, she\u0027s also the ultimate Netflix marathon companion and will gladly sit through just about any show! Are you ready to be Yancey\u0027s forever family? She\u0027s ready to be yours truly!"

    "description": "Here is one Juice that we\u0027d like to see get loose! From our shelter, at least. We can\u0027t wait for him to move in with his family! This happy adult would be a goofy, lovable addition to your home. Juice can be a real homebody. He enjoys getting in plenty of lounging around the house and loves looking out the window. He\u0027s crate-trained, though he does very well outside of his crate when left alone and doesn\u0027t get into any trouble. He\u0027s just a cuddly guy who likes to get cozy with his favorite people. Despite Juice\u0027s size, he can be dainty - he\u0027ll wake you up in the morning with a gentle little nuzzle and asks for pets by softly leaning up against you. His foster gave him a treat he didn\u0027t care for, so he hid it, so as not to hurt anyone\u0027s feelings. Although he has a moderate energy level, Juice does have a silly side that he likes to bring out and we love how he lopes along when he starts to run. Juice also has his guilty pleasure - tennis balls! Chasing, chomping, burying - he\u0027s got his own system down. Juice would home that could make sure he gets plenty of companionship with a side of exercise. A yard would be a plus, although Juice clearly enjoys life as an indoor dog. Some walks and a bit of swimming would be nice too. And don\u0027t forget that when you adopt from APA!, you\u0027re helping two dogs - the one you\u0027re welcoming into your home, and the next dog who will be able to join our program."

    "description": "Pebbles is a cuddle bug that is always up for an adventure! Her tail never seems to stop wagging with glee and her expressive face will melt your heart. You can read all her emotions just in the adorable way she perks her ears. Her gorgeous eyes truly seem to convey how much she loves you. Although she prefers to be the only animal in the house, she absolutely adores children! She is very well behaved when she\u0027s left along, and usually just occupies her time with naps or with her toys. She\u0027s also house trained and knows sit! Pebbles loves to run around the backyard, but is also up for a nice jog around the block. Walks can be a pretty entertaining endeavor as she gets a bit distracted by moving objects, specifically squirrels. She thinks they should all be her toys. She loves toys, and when she\u0027s playing that is her only focus. She has the most enthusiastic energy and really just loves to play and have fun! This sweet girl is the affection queen! She is so devoted to her people, and prefers to be as close to them as she can be. She is the best napping buddy, and loves to lay her head in your lap. She\u0027ll even let you rest your head on her if you\u0027re sleepy! Her current foster says she tries to get work done, and if Pebbles jumps up beside her it\u0027s nearly impossible to resist putting work away and snuggling. Pebbles\u0027 ideal home would have a roomy backyard where she can really stretch those athletic legs. She would also love to have a family that is able to spend lots of time with her, and give her lots of attention. She is so full of love and loyalty and cannot wait to show her forever family just what an amazing companion she is. Come meet Pebbles! Her joy really is contagious!"

    "description": "Jabba the Mutt may be an ol\u0027 fella, but boy, does he have life in him! He came to us in a very rough shape, and was so malnourished, the poor little guy couldn\u0027t stand. His recovery has been remarkable, and now he is ready to conquer his way to a warm, cozy final destination: his own home. Through it all, Jabba has kept his dandy looks. His soft fur is growing back and he is being a champ at eating well and taking his medications. As most of us know, some ailments come along with age, but they are not an obstacle in Jabba\u0027s journey to find his forever family. Little Jabba is mellow and low energy, but he gets a little bolder each day. He loves chin and belly rubs, and will show his love and gratitude with a little kiss here and there. Jabba the Mutt has been through so much. He deserves to spend the rest of his days surrounded by people that adore him, a plushy pillow, all the treats and the certainty that there will never be a bad day, because he is home."

    "description": "Phoebe is a Golden Girl who loves to cuddle on her foster mom\u0027s lap and lick her arms while she types (She assures us this is only a minor distraction). This tiny lady is calm and friendly with several other dogs of all sizes in her foster home. And she mostly ignores the cat. But Phoebe prefers cuddles and attention from her human friends, especially gentle petting and being carried around, giving those gentle kisses. Phoebe is fairly active and healthy for a senior doggie and wants to be where her people are, trailing them around the house and yard. When she\u0027s feeling particularly feisty, she still romps and prances around with the energy and agility of a young pup. This loving, trusting, happy lady would love to spend her golden years in a home with loving humans and maybe with a gentle dog and cat companions. Come meet this sweet, adorable girl and see if she\u0027s right for yours."

    "description": "If you\u0027re looking for a playmate, come meet Clyde. This busy boy is eager to play! play! play! all day. He\u0027s delighted to play with other dogs, toys, people, or whatever\u0027s handy. And he loves to play fetch with balls and squeakies, then explore by sniffing his world. Clyde does have his snuggly side. Once he\u0027s got all his playing and exploring out of his system, he\u0027ll want to snooze at your feet. Plus he\u0027s house-trained and answers to the \u0027sit,\u0027 \u0027come,\u0027 \u0027drop\u0027 and \u0027stay\u0027 commands. This fun-loving boy is looking for a home that will take him to wide-open spaces to sniff and another dog or two to play with. If that sounds like your family, come meet Clyde!"

    "description": "\"Rowdy is an overstatement, but this young feller is looking for an active, fun household where he will happily serve as your co-pilot. Rowdy has been spending time in an APA! foster home, so he knows his way around a home. He\u0027s good in a crate, house-trained, and he knows basic commands. He\u0027s a smart young adult who learns quickly, and he\u0027d love to receive more training. He also loves to receive petting, and likes to stay close to his favorite people. But it\u0027s outdoors where Rowdy is really at home. He loves to be outside running around the yard, exploring, and generally having a good time. He\u0027s improving his leash manners, and will make a great walking partner - and he\u0027ll definitely be up for running too! At this stage of life, Rowdy has plenty of energy and would love to live with an active family who could help him stay on the move. He\u0027ll repay you with years of wonderful companionship, and plenty of affection. If you love active Austin, this would be the perfect dog to have at your side. And don\u0027t forget that when you adopt from APA!, you\u0027re helping two dogs - the one you\u0027re welcoming into your home, and the next dog who will be able to join our program."

He knows \"sit, \"shake, \"lie down, and \"go to your bed. Don\u0027t let his age fool you! He\u0027s a great walker and at the sight of the leash will spin in circles, chasing his tail, full of excitement. He is goofy pup and loves to play tug with his rope toy, chew his nylabone, and go for car rides. He is also great at taking baths!

    "description": "If a spunky, young dog with a desire to learn is what you\u0027re looking for, come to Austin Pets Alive! to meet Ziggy. Imagine adopting a dog who already has the foundation of obedience - obeying sit, down, place (in progress), walking on leash. Ziggy is a very playful guy, and he loves to run, run and run some more. Ziggy is very treat-oriented, making training a fun time for you both. When walking on leash, he\u0027s sometimes so focused on his handler and the treat, he\u0027ll walk right into fences. Ziggy enjoys learning new things and is in the Total Obedience Program. The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modelled after the AKC\u0027s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Ziggy has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help him learn the skills to become the best dog he can be! He is learning skills like sit and down, walking nicely on leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers or other dogs, staying in a sit or down until told \"free,\" and coming when called. Once Ziggy successfully completes all the skills on his training plan he will be considered TOP Dog Ready! Ziggy is working hard to become a wonderful pet and as a part of APA\u0027s Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with Ziggy after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA\u0027s CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https://vimeo.com/89434193 Ziggy is going to grow into his body and his manners; just you wait and see what training and love will do for him. He wants to be yours! This goofy boy will melt your heart and empty your treat pouch."

People can\u0027t help but comment what a handsome, dignified dog he is. Although, Bass Master is a high energy dog, he is fantastic on leash - strolling along at his human\u0027s pace and calmly taking in the world. Bass Master is one of those dogs who wants to get acquainted with a new person before getting affection, but once he does he leans on his new friends for petting and shoves his head under their arms for hugs. Described as moderately toy motivated, he enjoys play tug-o-war and chasing balls. After his walks, he\u0027s been known to grab a toy and take it for a swim in the kiddie pool. Bass is looking for a home, preferably with a lot of space to run in, where his human companions can continue his training and return all the love he gives."

    "description": "All dogs are special in their own way. Some of just wear their \u0027special\u0027 a little more obviously. Unlike most dogs his age, Spencer is strong and full of energy. And age is really just a number, isn\u0027t it? He\u0027s very capable of playing and having fun whether he\u0027s using \u0027his wheels\u0027 or scooting around without them. In fact, his wheels are such a part of Spencer that you might even forget that he has them (he definitely does sometimes). Just like other dogs, he likes to be scratched and rubbed and loves to play fetch. He\u0027s also really good with other dogs and kids, the more the merrier. So, if you have a backyard and a great big heart that are both missing a little something special, come check him out. With a few years under his belt, Spencer has learned the value of love from a good human. If you are looking for a special furry friend who is loyal, obedient and adoring...look no further. Spencer\u0027s your guy."

Peggy Sue might not jump into your lap or be ready for cuddles right away. She\u0027s been around the block a few times and had a bit of a hard life. But once she decides you are nice, she\u0027ll want to be with you. She will follow you from room to room and show you how happy she is to see you when you come back! One thing that has her full heart is FOOD. She really comes alive when you are cooking in the kitchen, performing elaborate jumps and choreography to get a better look at what you may be cooking. We know Peggy Sue will be the perfect companion for someone with a lot of love (and treats) to share! If you\u0027re a person who values a full belly just like Peggy Sue, come meet her today."

In fact, he enjoys running around playing chase with his volunteer friends. Did we mention he is friendly? He assists to our daily playgroup where he has doggie friends that he romps around with.

As a TOP dog, Knighten has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help him/her learn the skills to become the best dog he can be! He is learning skills like sit and down, walking nicely on leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers or other dogs, staying in a sit or down until told \"free,\" and coming when called. Once Knighten successfully completes all the skills on his training plan he will be considered TOP Dog Ready! Knighten is working hard to become a wonderful pet and as a part of APA\u0027s Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with Knighten after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together.

Don\u0027t go all the way to the Crescent City to find your next dog. Lucinda is a sweet, fun dog who would love a chance to meet your family. Lucinda has lived in a home before and knows her way around. She has solid leash manners, and should make a great walking partner. And after the walk, she\u0027ll just ask for water. But take care walking her along the side of the road, because she loves going for car rides and wants to jump into back seats. And then you\u0027ll have to roll down the windows, because she loves to feel the breeze! Lucinda also loves to get in some exercise by playing fetch. You\u0027ll give her the big red sun blues if you don\u0027t throw her a few tennis balls every day. Is the night too long for her? Hardly. Lucinda likes to stay somewhat active with walk and play time, but she also enjoys her beauty sleep. She\u0027s got a medium energy level that will be a great match for a somewhat active home. Did we mention that Lucinda is a people lover? You can expect some passionate kisses from her. Who can blame her? She just wanted to see you so bad! She\u0027s got a great disposition; she seems to always be in a good mood (and on the hunt for her next belly rub). We think she would be a good candidate to share a home with kids. Lucinda enjoys learning new things and is in the Total Obedience Program. The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modelled after the AKC\u0027s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test.

    "description": "Do you like swimming? Do you have a pool? If so, have we got the perfect swimming partner for you! Meet Starfish. Starfish is the oldest known dog to have swimmer\u0027s syndrome and survive to be a year old. Swimmer\u0027s Syndrome is a birth defect that is usually treated and recovered from as an infant pup. (see http://www.thedogplace.org/REPRODUCTION/Swimmer-Pup-Syndrome_Lanting-1310.asp) In Starfish\u0027s case it does not appear she was treated. Instead at around 6 months old she was found in a box in a park. It was quickly discovered that she was suffering from advanced swimmer\u0027s syndrome. Starfish immediately had all 4 legs placed in casts and bound together to attempt to resolve the issue quickly. Starfish showed a desire to eat her way out of any restraints she was placed in so alternate treatment methods were created. Multiple special items have been made for her to help her be able to be off of the ground and attempt to have a somewhat normal life while also having her legs bound together. At this point, Starfish is able to hold herself up on her back legs and is able to move herself around with her back legs as the main support and then her front legs, while bound together, act as a \"tripod\" effect for her. Starfish has a very devoted and dedicated neurotherapist who will continue to see her locally until she is recovered. She has also had consults at veterinarian practices who have suggested acupuncture and laser therapy along with the binding of her front legs. Through all of this Starfish\u0027s personality and spirit has remained happy and loving. She is an absolute doll to snuggle with and if you love the way a train sounds, then you will laugh at her snorty snorts that occur throughout the day! Starfish currently is living in a foster home that has introduced her to many things. She has lived with dogs, cats, infants, toddlers, rabbits, chinchillas, and pot belly pigs. Starfish does very well in her foster home with meeting new animals, but her foster family also is a very experienced family and knows how to manage her. Outside of the foster home her level of tolerance is much lower and she has shown some reactivity. She is currently working with the behavior team to help work through her fear based issues with meeting new animals outside of her home. If you have another animal or animals it will be suggested that several meetings occur with the behavior team and Starfish and your animal(s). If you are an only dog home, you are a couch potato that likes to swim in your backyard pool, and you are looking for a one of a kind lifelong friend, then Starfish is your girl! Even if you have no pool, she would love to meet you still! Please contact us if you would like to hear more about our one of a kind amazing miracle girl!"

    "description": "Flora is a beautiful dog with very distinctive markings sure to turn heads wherever she goes. But the most beautiful thing about her is her eyes. They are so soulful and expressive, you will never have to wonder what Flora is thinking. And most of the time, she is thinking LOVE. Flora is house trained, calm in her crate and knows sit and shake. Her favorite game is tug of war, but fetch is fast catching up, if she ever fully gets the hang of it. She\u0027s pretty close. Though she loves to play, her most favorite thing is being next to her people. If she has her way, she would always have a least one little bit of her touching you. Her paw, her head, the tip of her tail. She loves to know you are close and safe. Flora is a sweet, trusting and adoring soul who deserves a great family to love on. Come meet her!"

    "description": "Arwen is a sweetheart who has had quite enough adventuring and is looking to settle down. She is house-trained, super well-behaved in the home and great on leash. It was no problem to leave her unsupervised with full outdoor access via doggie door. She has no desire to escape - a nice home is just fine, thank you. Once you are in her circle of trust, she will love on you and cuddle forever. Women and children get a free pass into the circle immediately. Arwen is incredibly smart. She didn\u0027t seem to have much training at all when she first entered foster, but she was house-trained and learned sit and down within a day. Once she understands what you want from her, she\u0027s happy to give it. She also knows how to ask for what she wants. She\u0027ll nudge you with her paw when she wants pets or twerk in your direction when she wants a butt scratch. Arwen is a clever and resourceful dog who has survived out in the world on her own. She\u0027s over that, though and would rather use all of her street smarts in the service of being an awesome house pet. Maybe she\u0027s what\u0027s missing from your home."

    "description": "Boomer is one of the happiest, most laid back guys on the block - constantly wagging his tail, smiling, and giving lots of love through kisses and cuddles! He is very chill and well-adjusted-- at about 9 years old, he loves his beauty rest - and is just fine in an apartment/condo lacking a yard. Boomer if fully house-trained (zero accidents at his foster\u0027s home to date), and very well-mannered -- he knows basic commands and is a good listener. Boomer is happy to cuddle up on the couch or in bed with you, but also responds immediately to the word \"No\" and is just as happy in his own bed. Despite the fact that he could nap all day, Boomer loves getting outside and exploring his surroundings. He even loves to jog a bit by your side if your up to it. He also loves a friendly, gentle game of tug-of-war and absolutely loves his soft toys and a good chew stick. Boomer may do alright with an older dog, or a younger dog who airs on the calmer, quieter side. Boomer does fine around kids, and would probably appreciate the energetic playmate! Boomer can be left alone, uncrated without any issues at all - he likes his naps when it\u0027s just him at home! He\u0027s a total sweetheart who will make the right individual or family happy for years to come!"

She gets very excited when she spots one of her people from her kennel. Kibby especially loves getting out of the shelter and going for walks on the trail. She does well on leash, strolling right along with her human. She\u0027s an adventurous, spirited pup who wants to explore new scenery, so she\u0027s never boring to walk with. If she has a space to roam around in, she always comes back to her person every few minutes to check in. And if she can hop into your lap, even better! Kibby is looking for a quiet, warm home with a comfy bed, a person to love and one where she can feel safe and secure. If that sounds like yours, come meet Kibby!"

    "description": "Alonso is one of the most people-oriented dogs you\u0027ve ever met. If you\u0027re sitting, he\u0027s hopping up on your lap. If you\u0027re standing, he\u0027s gazing up at you adoringly (especially if you happen to be standing near the kitchen). If you\u0027ll let him nap with you, he\u0027ll curl up, use you as a pillow, and snore the hours away. But he\u0027s not a one-person type of pup - he loves everybody. He\u0027s an active guy: he loves chewing on a bone, massacring a squeaky toy, etc. He\u0027s got a bit of a bum leg right now that the APA medical team is going to look at, but he\u0027s not letting it slow him down. He loves going on the trail, wading in shallow water, and rolling around in the grass. When he\u0027s back to his fully-four-legged-self, I think he\u0027d be an awesome running and hiking companion. Alonso does have epilepsy, but is on meds managing the issue. He takes his meds like a champ, so that\u0027s a non-issue. That epilepsy doesn\u0027t take away from his zest for life--he\u0027s a loving, fun, active dog on every front. I don\u0027t know how you don\u0027t love a guy like this!"

    "description": "Knox is the happiest and most playful dog despite losing his eye sight to glaucoma. He\u0027s a wiggler and loves to play with his toys. Knox can hear and smell you from a mile away and knows when his favorite people (or toys) are nearby. Knox can get around by himself, but he appreciates it when there is someone to guide him when he needs it. He\u0027s lived in a home before and knows the house rules. Knox may be okay going home with another big dog. If you\u0027re interested in meeting this hunk, come pay him a visit!"

    "description": "Lazlo is a gentle old soul that is faithful and loyal to his core! Being rescued after Hurricane Harvey, this sweet guy has really been put through the ringer. His deep expressive eyes seem to tell a story of resilience. In spite of his struggles, this loving senior pooch has a joyful optimism that he\u0027ll find a wonderful companion to share his retirement years with. Lazlo is an angel in his crate and has fully mastered leash training. He has wonderful manners, never cries or chews, is house-trained and enjoys relaxing and naptime almost as much as he adores his people! Little Lazlo is an extremely talented shadow, following his people around wherever they go. His favorite pastimes are laying in laps and snuggling up on the couch. Lazlo has a loyalty to his people when he knows he\u0027s being taken care of and his entire world revolves around loving them. His current foster describes him as wanting to protect and love her always. Once you have gained his trust, this love bug will make sure you know his heart belongs to you. Having Lazlo in your life is incredibly rewarding, and his joy is contagious to say the least. Lazlo loves going for walks and has the most adorable energetic prance. He likes to fetch soft toys, but otherwise prefers to spend his time relaxing. He radiates bliss and contentment, knowing that all is right in his world when he\u0027s with his human. Even though he\u0027s in his senior years, deep down, there\u0027s a playful puppy who exudes love and gratitude that he\u0027s no longer in a tough situation. And he has the cutest little foxy ears that will absolutely melt your heart! Lazlo would do wonderfully in a home where he\u0027s the only animal as he\u0027s been on his own for so long. A calm, low traffic home would be perfect for him. This gentle little pooch would really thrive with someone that is able to hang out with him throughout the day, and is willing to take him on car rides. He still loves a good adventure, and really just wants to be the ultimate side kick! This faithful guy deserves the biggest second chance to live out his retirement in a loving home. Lazlo has the biggest heart and will never give up finding love. If you come meet him, he\u0027ll show you that he can be the best friend you\u0027ve ever had! He promises to give you his whole heart for the rest of his days!"

    "description": "Jennifer has some vision loss that may not return but that doesn\u0027t stop her! She learns quickly and navigates her surroundings well that you almost can\u0027t tell. Despite this, she is a little hesitant around new dogs but will warm up to them. Jennifer is a happy, fearless, loving, adventurous soul and just needs a family with lots of love and time to spend with her! Jennifer will get bursts of playfulness but mostly wants to sleep on the couch. Jennifer likes to be around people and will curl into a ball on the couch next to you, but is not overly affectionate. She walks very politely on the Easy Walk halter and is working on sit and come. She is create-trained, often returning to her crate on her own. Jennifer is a young lady who\u0027s eager to explore this new world she inhabits, whether it\u0027s searching through and around all those household objects or going for walks on her leash. Come visit Jennifer and see if you can give her the love she deserves."

Granny does well w my 11 yr old son and other dogs. She does not care for cats or rabbits, though. She is crate trained and seems to enjoy her \"safe space\" but loves to lay on kitchen tile while I cook. She loves car rides and VERY short walks. Granny is overweight (we are working on it w a fitness and nutrition regime) and has arthritis which limits her walking distance. She loves her treats and is thrilled to lick you and love on you when you return from work. She is loyal and affectionate and a great older companion!\""

    "description": "Barbie the most gentle, sweet pooch! This resilient girl is a Hurricane Harvey survivor, and was a long-time stray prior to that. She has had a tough life, but her bright expressive eyes exude pure love and affection. It will completely win your heart! She is an absolute angel in her crate, and is working on her \"sit, stay, lay down, and \"heel commands. She\u0027s house trained and absolutely mild mannered to her core. Barbie is so attentive, and even if she doesn\u0027t know an exact command, she\u0027ll do her best to follow instructions, and is amazingly well behaved. This affectionate lady loves to be petted and loves to be close to her person. She loves to sleep with her people at night, if they\u0027re ok with it, and will always be near if they\u0027re sitting at a desk or another chair. This sweet girl loves her people so much, she will follow them around and will keep a close protective eye on their every move. When you come home, she will do a comical bounce and bat her paws around. It\u0027s pretty endearing! Barbie loves to be lazy, and her sleep time is something she thoroughly cherishes! She likes to go on walks for a while, but eventually will hilariously try and turn around to go home. After a long snooze, she also can get pretty playful, but settles down very quickly again. Her current foster says that Barbie doesn\u0027t like to get her feet wet, and when it\u0027s raining really pushes how long before she\u0027s willing to go out and take care of her business. She can be quite the silly pooch. Barbie is such a sweetheart, and she deserves to feel the reassurance that her love will be reciprocated. She would probably thrive in a home where she\u0027s the only other dog, as she hasn\u0027t been around many in her life. Mostly, Barbie just wants a home with soft spaces where she can nap, and a loving family that will adore her for all her days! Come meet Barbie! Her deep beautiful eyes will melt you to the core!"

    "description": "Kobu really wants to make your acquaintance. This handsome, funny, goofy, loyal and protective boy is one who takes a little time to warm up to a stranger, but when he does, the time you have invested in him is well rewarded with wiggles and affection. Kobu is hoping you are the person/family who will take a chance on him. He wants you to come and visit for some meet and greets so he can get to know you and he can let his charming personality be known as he slowly makes you his special friend(s). As his foster mom states, \"he will have your back forever. Kobu has medium energy and enjoys jumping and playing with all manner of toys, but he also enjoys simple hangout time too. He has great leash skills and is non reactive to people, cats and dogs when on a walk. He is soooo smart. He knows a ton of commands, such as \u0027come\u0027, \u0027sit\u0027, \u0027down\u0027, \u0027rollover\u0027, \u0027place\u0027, \u0027shake\u0027 and \u0027drop\u0027. Whew...and he\u0027s ready to learn everything else you want to teach him. Kobu is nervous around other dogs though better with smaller and daintier ones. He hasn\u0027t been fully observed with cats but mostly seems to ignore them when out on walks. If you love bringing out the best in others, come meet Kobu a few times and see how a little trust and love can do wonders for this faithful fellow."

He is so overjoyed by a good butt scratch, he folds himself up into a fat furry donut of love and happiness when he gets them. Kit also really loves walking around with tennis balls in his mouth and he\u0027ll even pick one out before he goes for a walk. \"Hmm, what are we in the mood for today, old chap? Perhaps a Penn 100? Smells like it was a good year.\" Kit has lived in a home before, he is house-trained, and will tell you when he needs to go out. He walks great on a leash and he knows sit. He\u0027s one of those dogs who can\u0027t help but bring a smile to your face. And who doesn\u0027t need more of that in their life?"

    "description": "Burgundy is another Gulf transplant from the recent hurricane, and we\u0027re happy to welcome her to Austin. We see a lot of sweet, friendly dogs, but Burgundy\u0027s disposition really stands out. She is gentle and loving with pretty much everyone she meets. We\u0027re not sure of her full history, but it seems like she\u0027s been in a home before. She learns the rules quickly, she\u0027s fully housebroken, and she\u0027s usually quiet around the house. Her foster has said that they\u0027ve barely heard her bark. She\u0027s also a smart, perceptive dog and can read human body language like nobody\u0027s business. Burgundy has a moderate energy level - she loves going for walks, although she prefers to keep them to shorter distances. Her other main exercise outlet is chasing around the ol\u0027 tennis ball. She is great at fetch and likes to keep the game going for a while. Burgundy seems like a versatile dog who will be able to fit into most family environments, though we think she would prefer a home where she could receive (and provide) a lot of companionship. She\u0027s looking forward to moving to her permanent home, and doesn\u0027t seem too picky! And don\u0027t forget that when you adopt from APA!, you\u0027re helping two dogs - the one you\u0027re welcoming into your home, and the next dog who will be able to join our program."

    "description": "Bowen is a curious, energetic, people-lover! He was rescued in Houston after Hurricane Harvey, and is a total trooper. His expressive eyes seem to be saying \"please play with me...or accidentally drop your sandwich! Either one will make me the happiest dog in the world! This friendly guy is great with other dogs, and is also a fan of children! He is quickly learning his leash skills, and we know it won\u0027t take him long to also master house training. He does well in his crate as long as he\u0027s alone at home. He gets sad if he\u0027s locked up and knows that his people are nearby. If he had his way, he\u0027d be permanently attached to his person\u0027s side! He is the king of cuddling, and is a big fan of napping with his head on laps, or snuggled up to his canine siblings. He loves being with his people so much, that his current foster says he stands guard and chases the bubbles from her hot tub! Bowen also adores the water hose, and would probably enjoy swimming, although he hasn\u0027t been yet. Active and curious are two characteristics that Bowen completely embodies! He loves to run laps in the backyard, and will play until he is totally beat. He\u0027s always happy to chase balls, play tug of war with his ropes, and chew on bones. This funny guy feels the responsibility to explore every inch of the house, the yard, and every bush on a walk. He is incredibly aware of his surroundings, and adorably observant! Bowen is full of sweetness, and such a great companion. He cannot wait to meet his forever family and start showing his love and affection for them! His ideal home would let him join in on any family adventures. He reveres his outside time, and would be thrilled if he joined a family that appreciated that. Mostly, Bowen just wants a home that will love him forever! Come meet Bowen! He promises to be the best friend he can be!"

    "description": "If a facial expression is worth a thousand words, Donnie is a four legged dictionary. He knows how to work those hazel eyes and he\u0027s not afraid to throw in a head tilt or eyebrow lift to finish off melting your heart. He really aims to please and will constantly check in with you, seeking your approval. Donnie is a 4 year old lab mix that wants to be by his human\u0027s side for everything life throws at you. He\u0027s a versatile companion. He enjoys lounging at home snuggling with his human, going glamping, going on jogs through serene trails, letting his jowels flap in the wind on road trips, and having a few material items to call his own. Like a fold up chair. He doesn\u0027t believe he should be expected to lay or sit on the ground. Donnie is crate trained and house trained. He\u0027s never once had an accident inside and will wait for you to show him exactly where it\u0027s acceptable to go to the bathroom when exploring new places. Donnie loves kids and adults alike and he handles other dogs well out on the town. Donnie would be a good fit for any active person or family."

    "description": "Bertha is a calm, peaceful girl who spends much of her time waiting at a window watching for her human friends to come home. And she\u0027s so happy to see them, wiggling and offering her head for pets! This shy, sweet girl was rescued in Houston from Hurricane Harvey and brought to Austin, where she\u0027s now happy to lounge in foster care and following her new people from room to room. She\u0027s a well-behaved, house trained girl who asks for very little activity or entertainment. Bertha hasn\u0027t been observed with dogs other than those encountered on walks, but she\u0027s living with two cats and getting along well with them. And she\u0027s living nicely with a rambunctious 5-year-old child, not bothered by him at all. This easygoing, low-maintenance girl should fit well into homes with gentle people who will return her love. Come meet her today!"

    "description": "Mortimer is the most gentle, angelic, easy going fella! This sweet guy has really been through some painful events, as he was found on the side of the road with a spinal injury. This resilient pooch has risen above that and now happily rolls along in his wheelchair! Mortimer is the epitome of courageous, and is absolutely a glass half full kind of guy! This friendly pooch adores other dogs and currently is in foster with nine canine buddies where he likes to run around playing chase with them. He is incredibly well-mannered, is great in his crate, never cries or barks and loves to go for walks in his wheelchair. He is really such a good-natured guy and such a great companion! Affectionate is an absolute understatement when describing this lovable pooch! He adores being close to his people, and really seems to say, \"thank you for taking care of me when he looks deep into your eyes. He is always happy and content to be with you, and loves to snuggle his head in your lap. Due to his injury, Mortimer needs a loving home that will continue to help him get stronger. Though he\u0027s able to take a few steps on his own, he may never fully regain the use of his back legs, and just needs a little extra help and attention. His ideal home would be single story with a back yard so he can have easier access to green space. He really just wants a relaxed home environment with people that love him as much as he\u0027ll love them back. Come meet Mortimer! His vibrancy and joy is so contagious!"

    "description": "From Hunny\u0027s foster: \"Hunny is very sweet and has a very calm demeanor. I live downtown so everything down here is new to her and she\u0027s doing a great job with stairs, elevators, town lake trail and all the hustle and bustle of downtown. She loves to turn around and look at you with a big smile while she\u0027s on a walk. She\u0027s also happy to just hang out and chew on a rawhide. She\u0027s really good at taking naps too! If you give her a really good butt scratch or petting, she\u0027ll follow you around for a good 10 minutes. Then she will easily go back to her bed and hang out at your feet. She seems to respond fairly well to verbal cues like \"stop\", \"slow\" and \"this way\". She has only passed kids on the street on leash and has no reactivity. She met two small dogs yesterday on leash and seemed to enjoy them. Ultimately, I think she\u0027d be perfectly happy with a back yard, a few walks, children who understand that she\u0027s still a little timid and shy - so she\u0027s not going to be a lover right away. But she\u0027s coming around to me every day more and more. She would probably be great with dogs who have her same energy level.\" Hunny is a beautiful wall flower. It\u0027s easy to pass her by because she\u0027s so quiet and reserved around people she doesn\u0027t know. But once she knows you are a friend, she blossoms. Hunny is smart and observant. She\u0027s pretty tuned in to what her human wants, and adapted to walking both in the heart of the city and on the trails quickly. She prefers a bit of nature. She\u0027s a bit of a hippie chick. She is housetrained, well-behaved when left alone, and is about a medium energy dog. She is happy to nap all day but really appreciates a good walk. She even seems to know some commands like \"stop.\" Her favorite things are raw hides and butt scratches, and those things are the shortcut to her heart. Hunny doesn\u0027t open up to just anyone but she is well worth the effort. Come meet her!"

    "description": "The face that launched a thousand squeals... it\u0027s hard to look at Nia and keep your composure. There is just something about her wrinkled, spotted face that makes everyone want to stop, meet her, and then swoon. This gentle giant can seem a little stoic, but has been known to sneak kisses and snuggle once she\u0027s comfortable with you. Nia has a calm, casual demeanor, but she really comes alive when you take her for a stroll. She gets a spring in her step and a wag in her tail when heading to the trail or around the neighborhood. It wasn\u0027t always this way, as Nia came to APA in pretty bad shape - emaciated and mostly hairless. After surgery and lots (and lots!) of food, this warrior not only survived, but has thrived in APA\u0027s care. Nia has lived in a foster home and has proven to be gentle and loving with children. She is crate-trained, laid-back and an overall chill girl whose only demands are lots of walks and lots of love! Come meet this volunteer favorite and be prepared to fall for sweet, easy, squishy Nia."

    "description": "Donald is as unique as they come! He is a coon hound from Beaumont, saved during the historic floods. He had the misfortune of catching distemper during the hurricane but is now past it. The disease is no longer contagious but he was left with some muscle tremors that will slowly go away over the next year or two. It makes him really stand out in a crowd. There is no need to baby this lover boy though! He plays with dogs and acts like nothing is wrong. He is pretty mellow- preferring to nap most of the time but loves to go on walks and loves to cuddle with his people. He is housetrained and knows how to sit for treats. He will steal your heart in less than 5 minutes if you give him the opportunity. With his bounce, he will be doing his part to Keep Austin Weird and you can do your part to Keep Austin No Kill by adopting him!"

    "description": "Daphne is a nuzzler! This sweetheart loves to rub her head or nose against you and will not say no to a good butt scratch! Daphne ponders life as she ambles along next to you on a walk at a medium clip, thinking of tasty treats or curling up in her very own cozy bed. She is not overly interested in toys, but that doesn\u0027t mean she can\u0027s be a silly girl, rolling around on her back in the grass making snorting noises or trying to play detective by sniffing interesting things out on a walk. Daphne is a strong-spirited, mature, medium energy lady who has probably seen her share of life\u0027s harder edges and would truly appreciate the chance to thrive in a loving home where she can relax and enjoy the finer things in life. Until she finds her family, Daphne is busy working on some of her basic commands like sit, down, and basic leash skills. If you\u0027re looking for an easy going, affectionate, and mellow dog Daphne definitely wants to meet you!"

    "description": "Handsome Tony is the strong, silent type- a distemper survivor, he never complains and puts up with our tomfoolery like a champ. He is sweet and kind, but still a little scared of people, although once he starts to trust you he just wants to curl up next to you while you work or relax. He is beautifully house trained, and so good in the house, sitting quietly until it\u0027s time to go out. He lived in an office at APA for many weeks while overcoming distemper and he was very patient with his office sibling, a little puppy who loved to bounce on him and eat his food and sneak into his crate to snuggle up with him. If you are looking for a sweet, well behaved, loyal companion, Tony may be the man for you!"

This cheerful pup loves playtime - swimming (his favorite!), fetch, walks, you name it! Diego will entertain himself indefinitely with a pool to splash around in. He is also eager to learn and is doing a great job with training. He already knows sit and shake, and his leash skills are coming along nicely. If you are looking for an active and lovable companion to join you on your adventures, Diego may be the dog for you. Come by APA! to meet this goofball today!"

    "description": "Malik is all about love. When you show him kindness, he wants to be your friend and cuddle up next to you. He loves to gently put his head on your knee and just gaze into your eyes. This well-behaved pup seems to be house broken since his kennel is always clean and when he gets to go out he does his business right away. He is just learning to play with toys and loves training. He\u0027s mastering giving eye contact and walking nicely on a loose leash and is now learning to take and hold a sit. He\u0027s happy for the attention that goes along with training and is eager to please. In a play yard, if his walker is busy he will explore on his own until he hears his name, and then he\u0027s ready for whatever he gets to do with you. Malik didn\u0027t come from a great situation, but at APA the great dog he always had inside has been coming out. Whoever gets to take him home will be so lucky! All he wants is a safe place to lay his head and a loving person to tell him what a good dog he is. Is that you?"

    "description": "Sweet Franklin is a Michael Phelps wannabe! He adores swimming and is fearless in the water. He is also a member of our RuffTail Runners group, where he gets to join our volunteer runners for strolls on the Lady Bird trail. Looking for an all-around good hiking mate? Look no further! His paws were made for walkin\u0027, and he will be right by your side for new adventures for the small price of a bowl of iced water. Franklin has started to gather a following at the shelter. Recently, he was invited on a sleepover to a volunteer\u0027s home, where he was a gentleman; no begging for food, no getting on furniture and no potty accidents. He is very obedient and well-behaved and can sit on command, so we know he has some training in his past. Franklin seems like a dog who will bond closely with his family; he quietly allows pets and grooming of his gorgeous coat while probably thinking \"oh, I\u0027m so lucky to have you, please don\u0027t stop\". Come on down and check out this handsome ball of fluff. It\u0027ll be love at first sight."

    "description": "Evander looks like a jock, but he\u0027s actually more of an intellectual introvert. He prefers small, quiet gatherings to loud raucous groups. In his kennel, he sits prim and proper to be suited up for a walk. He walks great on leash and has even mastered the elusive \"loose leash\" walking. When it comes to playing fetch, however, all decorum goes out the window. He hops and barks and generally makes a scene. But he\u0027s always gentle when returning it . It is his very favorite thing in the world. Evander is house-trained and knows \"sit\". Once he knows you, he likes to rest his giant head in your lap to get ear scratches. He\u0027s known for being a very good patient at the vet, and he\u0027s even donated blood! Evander is a handsome and proper gentlemen looking for a family to please, and one that will throw him the ball. Come meet him!"

    "description": "Twigs is a beautiful girl that desires love more than anything. This sweet pooch has been through a lot, having recently been rescued in Houston after Hurricane Harvey. She deserves all the love in the world and can\u0027t wait to find her perfect family so she can put all her sadness behind her. We believe Twigs has lived on her own as a stray, and is still learning to adapt to her new life. But she is very comfortable around other dogs, and actually seems to prefer to be in their company. She loves to play and run around the yard playing tug of war with her pooch foster siblings. She is partial to bones and likes de-stuffing any of her stuffed toys. She leaves a funny fluff trail behind her so it\u0027s never hard to track her down! Twigs doesn\u0027t seem to realize that she can play with people, and is still learning that that is an option. Having other dogs in the home really seems to be key in helping this sweet girl come out of her shell. Twigs can be shy when she encounters people. Gaining Twigs\u0027 trust is an absolutely beautiful and rewarding feat and she so clearly yearns for love, but just doesn\u0027t quite understand how to go about accepting those emotions and actions yet. There are days that she will come right up to you and enjoy being pet, and others where she likes to keep her distance. Day by day, Twigs shows her excitement when her current fosters come home. She watches their every movement, and is incredibly observant when they show affection to her dog siblings. It\u0027s obvious that she not only appreciates it, as her tail joyfully wags, but that she gets closer each day to joining the snuggles herself. With a gentle voice, and patience, she will occasionally accept pets on her head, and has even grown to enjoy ear and neck massages! Although proving you\u0027re a faithful person to Twigs is a process, once you\u0027ve gained that trust, you will have a wonderful, loyal companion. This smart lady does well in her crate, although her current foster says she\u0027s well behaved enough that she is able to roam the house while they\u0027re gone. They have a doggy door that Twigs picked up on immediately, and she appears to be a very quick learner. She would really benefit from a home with a yard for her to run in and take care of her business, as walks are so foreign to her. She knows her name, and will come when she hears it. This mellow girl likes to lounge on the couch or her bed. She also can be found basking in the sun outside watching the clouds float by. She seems to appreciate her alone time and getting lost in her thoughts. She has a strong curiosity about the world around her and you really can\u0027t help but want her to embrace life and truly excel. Twigs has had a tough life and deserves to be a welcomed, adored member of a loving home. Her ideal home would definitely have canine siblings that can give her comfort and companionship, and show her that people are there to love and protect her. So come and meet Twigs! She can\u0027t wait to show you what an amazing companion she can be!"

    "description": "Momma Mia! This big-hearted lady is a displaced Hurricane Harvey dog who is looking for a new family here in Austin. And based on how well she\u0027s doing in her APA foster home, we think she\u0027ll make a quick transition to her forever family. As her name suggests, Momma recently had a litter of pups and she\u0027s been busy tending to her motherly duties. But now she\u0027s ready to get back into the swing of things. Momma seems to like a quiet atmosphere and a slower pace. She can be shy at first, but once she settles in, she\u0027s proven to be a sweet, affectionate pup. Momma has gone through some changes recently, and we think more of her personality will start to show once she has some consistency in her life. Her fosters are seeing more silly, playful behavior from her. One thing we can tell you for sure is that she is a loyal, eager to please dog who should become a great companion for you family. She learns the rules of the home quickly, and enjoys being around her people. This girl is deserving of a loving home. Come meet her and see if she\u0027s perfect for yours!"

    "description": "Chato is a young fella with a lot of potential. We don\u0027t think he had a lot of training or consistency in his life before he arrived at APA, but now that we\u0027ve got him he\u0027s learning quickly, and is anxious to take his skills to his new family. Chato can be shy when first introduced to new people, but once he warms up he is a wiggly ball of affection. He has a playful side that is really coming out now that he is learning all about toys. Rope toys, tug toys, tennis balls - he has fun with all of them. We\u0027ve been teaching Chato some basic skills and he is proving to be a quick learner. His leash skills have improved dramatically, and he should turn into a great walking partner. He is a people-pleaser who would love more to continue to train and learn. And don\u0027t forget that when you adopt from APA!, you\u0027re helping two dogs - the one you\u0027re welcoming into your home, and the next dog who will be able to join our program."

She is in APA\u0027s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) program and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week toward the goal of passing the American Kennel Club\u0027s CGC test! Cupcake has been working hard to be a dog you can take anywhere with pride. To pass the CGC test, a dog must demonstrate obedience and general reliability in real world situations. Dogs in APA\u0027s CGC program learn to sit and down, walk nicely on leash, sit calmly when approached by strangers or another dog, won\u0027t approach people or dogs without permission, greet people appropriately, stay in a sit or down until told \"free,\" and come when called. As part of APA\u0027s CGC program you can work with APA to continue to build a training relationship with Cupcake after adoption and get officially CGC certified for free! Check out a video about CGC: https://vimeo.com/89434193 This smart girl will be happy to show off her new skills for you, and then hang out with you for some butt scratches. Come take this sweetie for a walk and see if she\u0027s perfect for your home."

He\u0027s a non-destructive, well-behaved boy who\u0027s very well crate and house trained. He likes playing tug-o-war and fetch, chasing toys and leaping like a bunny, making his human friends laugh. And he can keep himself entertained by chewing on his toys. Lawson is epileptic and needs two pills twice a day, which he\u0027s very good about taking. He\u0027s looking for a home where he can get all the love he deserves and is ready to return. Come meet this funny boy today!"

    "description": "Gage is a Hurricane Harvey survivor who is turning into a professional leash walker. This easygoing boy prances along the trail at his person\u0027s side and hardly notices those pesky quirrels. When this sweetie arrived from Houston, he was overwhelmed and scared, but then he found out people were dispensers of food, and today he could not be happier about his new life, learning that toys are fun to play with and doing zoomies. Gage enjoys learning new things. He already answers to the \u0027sit\u0027 and \u0027down\u0027 commands and is in APA\u0027s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) program, working with a volunteer trainer several times a week toward the goal of passing the American Kennel Club\u0027s CGC test! Gage has been working hard to be a dog you can take anywhere with pride. To pass the CGC test, a dog must demonstrate obedience and general reliability in real world situations. Dogs in APA\u0027s CGC program learn to sit and down, walk nicely on leash, sit calmly when approached by strangers or another dog, won\u0027t approach people or dogs without permission, greet people appropriately, stay in a sit or down until told \"free,\" and come when called. As part of APA\u0027s CGC program you can work with APA to continue to build a training relationship with B after adoption and get officially CGC certified for free! Check out a video about CGC: https://vimeo.com/89434193 Gage is a companionable boy who loves being smooched on. He will love a home where he can sunbathe and watch the world go by from a big window. Come take this boy for a walk and see if he\u0027s right for yours!"

Not only was she rescued during Hurricane Harvey, but also she was very sick when she came to APA. This little rock star has bounced back beautifully, and can\u0027t wait to put those crummy memories behind her and start life with her forever family! This pooch really is the epitome of resilient! Guinevere is such a good girl! She does wonderfully in her crate, is house trained, and has fully mastered walking on her leash. She loves playing with other dogs, and is even good with cats! She has been through so much, and is a bit shy when she meets new people. It doesn\u0027t take this sweet girl long to warm up, and once you\u0027re buddies, it is one of the most rewarding feelings! She adores her humans and likes to press her nose on you to show you she\u0027s your biggest fan! Her current foster says when you walk in the room that Guinevere bursts with elation and it will truly put you on cloud 9! Guinevere has an adorably curious nature, and loves to sniff around the house and yard to find out all the fun secrets it holds. She really blossoms when she\u0027s around other social, playful dogs, and likes to take their direction on what\u0027s allowed in the house. She seems to find a comfort having dog siblings around, and would greatly benefit from a home that could provide one for her. Guinevere mostly wants a home where she is loved and feels safe. With a little patience, Guinevere will be the most wonderful companion! She can\u0027t wait to move forward in life with her family and grow with them everyday. She just wants to belong. Come meet Guinevere! Her sweetness will absolutely melt your heart!"

    "description": "The benefits of adopting an older dog is that they know their role in life. Gidget knows her role. Her role is to be a loyal and loving companion to a special person, to be available but not pushy, and to try to understand her human\u0027s needs. She\u0027s played this role for someone else for a long time, and now is looking for her second act. Gidget is a pretty easy dog to have around. She loves to be near you, but she never begs for attention. She is patient with kids, cats and most other dogs. Gidget is house trained, walks well on a leash, and knows a couple of verbal and visual commands like sit and stay. She still has bursts of energy from time to time that don\u0027t last long, but she packs a lot of fun in while they do. You can tell she was pretty athletic when she was younger. Gidget also occasionally entertains herself by throwing her bones around on the deck. She is still able and willing to learn new tricks and is very attentive . She wants to be a good girl. Luckily, she doesn\u0027t have to try that hard. She just is. Gidget is everything you could want in a companion. Come meet her!"

    "description": "Eyes are the window to the soul it\u0027s said...and that\u0027s sure the case with Pony Boy whose special friend at APA! thinks he has hands down the most beautiful and expressive eyes in the land. You\u0027ll need to meet him to see what you think, but we think you will agree. Pony Boy is house trained, crate trained, has lived with a cat where both pretty much ignored one another, and older kids are a-ok in his book! He prefers people to other dogs, but with a good personality match and some introduction he could likely live harmoniously with another dog. Pony Boy loves snuggling and when it comes time for that activity he morphs into a cat and will rub on you or put his head in your hand or on your leg to let you know it\u0027s time for a love fest. He is a medium to low activity dog so won\u0027t require tons of exercise. But he does love bouncing around with some toys. Pony Boy enjoys learning new things and is in the Total Obedience Program. The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modeled after the AKC\u0027s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Pony Boy has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help him learn the skills to become the best dog he/she can be! He is learning lots of skills and already knows sit, down and walks great on a leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers or other dogs and staying in a sit or down until told \"free,\" and coming when called. Once Pony Boy successfully completes all the skills on his training plan he will be considered TOP Dog Ready! Pony Boy is working hard to become a wonderful pet and as a part of APA\u0027s Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with Pony Boy after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA\u0027s CGC program, on which the TOP was based:https://vimeo.com/89434193"

Then it\u0027s time to roll over for belly rubs. Macrame aloves to run and play, doing play bows, then running in circles. When you call her name, she comes running back with a big smile on her face. Once playtime is over, she\u0027s just as happy to relax and cuddle. Macrame is learning to walk nicely on leash and enjoys going on runs with her people. She answers to the \u0027sit\u0027 and \u0027shake\u0027 commands and loves going on car rides. Macrame is looking for a home where she can have a nice jog in the morning, followed by couch time binge-watching TV and eating gourmet treats. If that sounds like your routine, come meet this special girl."

    "description": "Lil Abner is a real dog\u0027s dog. Lovable, sweet, smart, affectionate, and patient are just a few words thrown around when describing this sweet boy. Just a little affection and Lil Abner will return it in spades; give his chest a rub and he\u0027ll rest his paw on you to show just how much he cares. He\u0027s a patient guy and gets along well with other dogs. He\u0027s a great listener and loves to cuddle, which makes him an easy friend to have. He\u0027s even easy on the eyes with his pretty auburn coat and gorgeous green/gray eyes. Insider tip: Lil Abner loooooves coconut oil. Treat him to some, and he\u0027ll literally be eating out of your hands. Lil Abner would love a home with a doggy sibling or two. He loves getting his exercise in the morning, running around and playing in a big backyard. Once he gets his energy out, he\u0027s a very mellow dog indoors, and just wants to lay around and be cuddled or watch the birds from the window. He\u0027ll kindly let you know when he needs to go out, and knows sit, shake, and lie down. Lil Abner is true gentleman and a real catch!"

    "description": "Curtis is a beautiful, dignified pup who knows his human friends want to be with him. And he\u0027s happy to give them that opportunity, especially if they\u0027ll play fetch and tug-o-war. When this sweet boy first meets new people, he wants to take his time to study them. Will they toss his ball? Will they let him rub against them? Will they applaud when he performs his tricks? When he decides they want to be his friend, he\u0027s ready to be their newest sidekick and starts dishing out cuddles and affection. Curtis is a smart pup and answers to the \u0027sit,\u0027 \u0027down,\u0027 \u0027stay,\u0027 \u0027come\u0027 and \u0027shake\u0027 commands, and he\u0027s quick to learn new skills. And if he doesn\u0027t feel inclined to show off his skills, he\u0027ll just turn into silly mode and toss his toys around. Curtis is looking for a home with humans who will appreciate his many talents, be a part of his fan club and can return the love he\u0027s ready to give. Come meet him and see if he\u0027s perfect for yours!"

    "description": "Tyra is two-third\u0027s hippie chick. Around people, she is as chill as chill can be. She loves to be pet, and to be near you. She has no problem being picked up and handled, despite the fact her size makes that an awkward process. And when she is outside, she is at one with nature. The bees and flowers are her friends. She basks in the sunshine, rolls in the grass, and sniffs and explores with an air that is downright spiritual. Tyra is house trained in every sense of the word. She is completely calm and respectful in the house, doesn\u0027t chew what should not be chewed and even walks daintily. She is big, but walks like a ballerina. She adores being near you, but won\u0027t climb or jump inappropriately. And she is cool being crated, if that if your preference. She loves to play with toys and will often greet her foster parent with her favorite toy in her mouth ready to play. The best home for Tyra would be one with a fenced-in yard. She would be a great candidate for a doggie door. The rest is a breeze. She\u0027s just a huge sweetheart. Tyra also enjoys learning new things. She\u0027s even trained for the Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test and recently became CGC Ready, which means she successfully passed the American Kennel Club\u0027s CGC test with her volunteer trainer! Tyra has been working hard to be a dog you can take anywhere with pride. To pass the CGC test, a dog must demonstrate obedience and general reliability in real world situations. An APA CGC-ready dog knows sit and down, walks nicely on leash, will sit calmly when approached by strangers or another dog, won\u0027t approach people or dogs without permission, greets people appropriately, stays in a sit or down until told \"free,\" and comes when called. As part of APA!\u0027s CGC program you can work with APA to continue to build a training relationship with Tyra after adoption and get officially CGC certified for free! Check out a video about CGC: https://vimeo.com/89434193"

    "description": "Remmy is a boy with loads of personality - sweet, hilarious, goofy and so much fun! This sweetheart is a Hurricane Harvey survivor who\u0027s come to Austin to find his way into the hearts of his new human friends, and he sure is succeeding. With a huge smile on his face, he just wants to be loved, wriggling and sneaking up behind his people to rest his head in their laps for cuddles. And then he\u0027s up for entertainment. He\u0027s an energetic boy who loves running in the yard with his favorite toy in his mouth, then wrestling and running with his foster dog sister. He also takes every single toy out of the bin when he goes outside and plays with each one of them. Here\u0027s what his foster mom says: \"He makes me laugh out loud daily, whether it\u0027s putting both front feet in his water bowl and splashing around, taking a running leap off the patio and getting a few seconds of air time, or stretching out on his back in the sun with a goofy smile on his face. Remmy is a curious, smart boy who already answers to the \u0027sit,\u0027 \u0027wait,\u0027 \u0027stay,\u0027 \u0027paw,\u0027 \u0027lie down,\u0027 and \u0027no\u0027 commands. He\u0027s house trained and working on his crate and leash training. Remmy is looking for an active home where he can be a companion on adventures, and one with older kids and dogs to play with would be ideal. Come have a fun meet-and-greet with this boy!"

With her love for attention, she loves to live life in the spotlight. You should see her break out into wiggles and wags when her volunteer friends bring out the costumes! Pay Starr a visit and you\u0027ll see that she lives up to her name. She does her own stunts, especially in the play yard when she\u0027s chasing after balls and catching them with ease in mid-air! She also loves to act out love scenes with her human pals. Lean in for some kisses and you\u0027ve got a friend for life! Her theatrics are rewarded with treats, which she will happily accept! She has already mastered some basic behavioral skills and is working on adding more tricks to her playbook. Off stage, she loves to cuddle and roll over for belly rubs. Starr is ready to take the show on the road and settle down in a forever home. She appears to be potty-trained and has shown great promise in being a good, calm girl on her own in the house. She even has potential to live with another dog. We have no doubt that she will make her future forever family very happy one day. Why not come visit Starr today? We dare you not to fall in love at first sight!"

    "description": "Harold is a solid name for a solid type of dog. He is certainly more of your big, brawny type, but he is really a lover underneath. His muscular frame is used mostly to gain optimal cuddling leverage. Harold does love playing with toys and goes to play group with other dogs, so he\u0027s not a total couch potato. But he\u0027s close. If you\u0027re looking for a laid back lug, Harold might be your man. Come meet him!"

    "description": "Isabel is a sweet, affectionate love bug! She was surrendered by her previous family who had too many dogs and couldn\u0027t properly take care of her. Isabel exudes incredible amounts of tenderness and companionship. She is such a gem! We believe Isabel would do well with a well-matched doggie buddy. She is house-trained and is working hard to master leash training as well. This smart lady knows several commands and does very well when told to go sleep in her bed. Isabel aims to please and gets really excited when you\u0027re happy with something she\u0027s done! This loving lady is also the cuddle queen! She adores her family members and wants to spend all her time with them. For all Isabel\u0027s snuggles, she also is adorably playful. You can often find her playing outside, chasing balls and munching on her chew toys. Isabel is overflowing with sweetness and really just wants a family that will accept her love. Come meet Isabel! She can\u0027t wait to be part of your pack!"

This sporty boy is always ready to leash up for runs around the lake, zooming past those other dogs, bikes and human runners. If you\u0027d rather walk than run, Doug is happy to slow down, too. He\u0027s on the RuffTail Runners team and he\u0027s up for whatever speed his human teammates want to do. This frisky boy also likes getting petting from his people. He\u0027s looking for an active home with older kids. Come take him for a walk and see if he\u0027s your future running mate."

    "description": "Aphrodite was the Goddess of Beauty and Love. When you meet Aphrodite, you will see she certainly delivers in the Love department. As for Beauty, it\u0027s impossible to look at her without smiling, which is beautiful in its own right. Aphrodite, or Ms. A. for short, is a perfect dog for a life of leisure. She is friendly and sociable, and loves to play a quick round of tug-of-war. But a jogger she ain\u0027t. A short jaunt around the block will about do it for Ms. A. Napping, on the other hand, is where she shines. She is an expert cuddler and has an adorable little snore. Aphrodite is crate-trained and nearly house-trained. She is easy to walk on a leash and is chill and well-behaved in most environments. Car rides, vet visits, patios, whatever. Ms. A. is cool with it. Just be prepared for a lot of attention. Her unique look and friendly personality tend to attract the affections of strangers. If you are looking for a funny face to wake up to every morning, then you should meet Aphrodite."

This well-behaved guy is house-trained, crate-trained, and has learned \"sit and \"down. He walks wonderfully on leash and is a big fan of trails! Howard is a quick learner and really aims to please his people. He absolutely loves to romp around the yard and run and loves to get you outside to play with him. Howard is an energy matcher - if you\u0027re excited, he\u0027s excited, if you\u0027re relaxed, he is too. He is a bit shy when he first meets new people, but once you\u0027ve won him over, you have a friend for life! Howard would love to be a part of a home that loves activity! He has lots of energy and loves long walks and getting plenty of exercise. As long as he gets activity, he\u0027d be totally fine living in an apartment. He mostly just wants lots of love and can\u0027t wait to meet his forever family! Come meet Howard, he promises to be the best pal he can be!"

Gozer has not been observed with cats though it is thought she would do just fine. She\u0027s a really easy dog to have around - quiet and not at all destructive. She is allowed to stay in her foster home without crating because her behavior is exemplary. Gozer wants approval and seeks it out. She is leash-trained and knows all her basic commands, so you\u0027ll be starting way ahead in the training game. Gozer loves to play and go on long walks. Do you like tossing? Well she likes fetching. She is a tennis ball fetching artist. And an added bonus, she would love to be a swimming partner because she really loves the water. Her foster family has given her the nickname, \"Bark Spitz. The sweet, loving, athletic Gozer is just looking for a family who will enjoy being active with her, but mostly she wants a family to love. Come meet Gozer and see if she\u0027s perfect for yours."

This adorable boy, with his great smile, is a smartie who already answers to the Drop, Sit and Down commands. And he\u0027s ready to learn many new things, if he can just be beside his human friends. Cuervo enjoys learning new things and is in the Total Obedience Program. The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modelled after the AKC\u0027s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Cuervo has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help him learn the skills to become the best dog he can be! He is learning skills like sit and down, walking nicely on leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers or other dogs, staying in a sit or down until told \"free,\" and coming when called. Once Cuervo successfully completes all the skills on his/her training plan he will be considered TOP Dog Ready! Cuervo is working hard to become a wonderful pet and as a part of APA\u0027s Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with Cuervo after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA\u0027s CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https://vimeo.com/89434193 This bouncy, energetic boy should do well with well-matched dog companions, and with older kids. Come visit and see if he\u0027s the one to share all the ups and downs of life with. He\u0027ll want to be by your side from that day forward.

    "description": "This handsome creature seems to be a cross between a majestic dire wolf and a huggable teddy bear. He\u0027s a distinguished gentleman but super playful and always has a big grin for his friends. And once he gets to know you, Omar will give little kisses that let you know he thinks you\u0027re the bees knees. Although large in size, he\u0027s an excellent walking companion - a total gentle giant that responds to the slightest tug on the leash. If you fall down, he\u0027ll come bounding over to make sure you\u0027re ok - what a romantic! Omar has great leash manners and loves to show off how he can sit for treats. He\u0027s eager to please and a quick learner - and will even shake your hand if you ask! When he gets excited, he\u0027ll spin in a circle and do little hops - but is always polite and knows to not jump on people. If you\u0027re looking for a loyal companion, a fuzzy huggable protector and an adventure buddy on the trails, come by and meet this sweet hunk! Follow Omar on Instagram @omar_the_akita"

    "description": "Tiki is a great fan of TV shows. That\u0027s because when her people are watching TV, she can curl up in their laps and soak up all their pets. This sweet girl is a survivor. She was hit by a car and left unable to walk, but that doesn\u0027t mean she can\u0027t get around. She can crawl and scoot and even do her version of a happy dance. She perks up when she sees her people, turning herself around and wagging that tail. Then she\u0027ll roll over one direction for a tummy rub, then roll the other way for another one. How cute! Tiki just wants attention and affection and gives plenty of love in return. She gets along well with gentle dogs and kids. Now in foster care, she is happy to nap in her playpen while her people are at work. Then when carried outside to potty, she does her business in just a minute or two. This gentle girl has special needs, but is easy to care for, just wanting some gentle handling and protection. She doesn\u0027t look back. She\u0027s glad to be alive and to continue enjoying her life. All she wants is to be a great companion in someone\u0027s home. Come see if she\u0027s perfect for yours."

This wiggly girl wants to be loved, and in return she\u0027ll love you to the moon and back, crawling in your lap and giving kisses. She\u0027s grateful for every rub and word of praise. Orbit is such an affectionate, eager-to-please lady who\u0027s also curious and very interested in whatever her people are doing. Plus, she gets along very well with her doggie friends and older kids. She hasn\u0027t been observed with cats or young children, but with her sweet disposition, she may do well with them, too. An energetic girl, Orbit enjoys going for walks and does well on leash. She\u0027s crate and house-trained and answers to the \u0027sit\u0027 command. And she enjoys her soft squeaky toys. Orbit is looking for a home where she can get that love and attention she adores. Come meet this adorable girl, with her constantly wagging tail, and see if yours is in her future."

    "description": "Do you believe in ghosts? At APA!, we believe in this one! No reason to be scared of him though. He\u0027s just a goofy young guy who is looking to find the right family. Ghost is currently spending time with one of our foster families, and he is showing us that he has the skills to make a quick transition to your home. He didn\u0027t have the best care in his younger days, but he has put that behind him and is ready to enjoy life to the fullest. Ghost was found with a broken back that has affected the use of his back legs and which makes him move clumsily. In spite of all that, he is very mobile and loves to play. We love his happy, silly attitude and his affectionate demeanor. Ghost wants to be everyone\u0027s friend. But he\u0027s also serious about learning the rules of the house and learning new commands. He is completely housebroken and picks up routines quickly. Ghost is sweet and playful with adult dogs and puppies. He currently lives with a large adult rottie and a medium size mix breed and is fine with them both. He briefly lived with two 7 week old puppies and was gentle but unsure of what to do with them! Ghost still has his puppy enthusiasm and loves to romp around and play with his chew toys. He\u0027s a big feller who can be very entertaining as he grows into his body. But he also has a mellow side - he loves to observe the world around him with a healthy level of curiosity. Give Ghost some attention, affection, and consistency, and he should be haunting your home for a long time to come!"

    "description": "Meet Presley, a hound mix who loves to explore the world with his hound nose. Walks involve a lot of sniffing, though he will keep up and focused on a jog. Are you a morning person? Great! Because Presley is ready to take a walk pretty much as soon as he wakes up. The rest of the day, he\u0027s as chill as can be. This calm boy has never been heard to bark at another dog or human, even when other dogs are barking or growling at him. He\u0027s just too friendly to get involved in all that. He hasn\u0027t been observed with cats, but he has shown no prey instincts with squirrels when out on walks. And he\u0027s seen to be very gentle with the only child he has met to date. Presley is learning fast. He is mostly house-trained and learned to sit in just a couple of days. He is learning about how his crate is his special place, though if he\u0027s in there, he\u0027s not with his person who might give him a chin scratch, which is one of his favorite things. Presley is a great guy waiting on his forever home. He\u0027d love a yard to sniff around, but mostly he\u0027d love for you to come meet him."

    "description": "Dalton was once a country boy. He came from a ranch, but now he\u0027s adapting very well to becoming a city slicker. He\u0027s a little shy at first, but once he feels safe, he becomes a very affectionate boy, pawing gently at his new human friends to ask for more petting, leaning against them, rolling over for belly rubs and nuzzling their chests. A playful boy now in foster care, he\u0027s still trying to figure out what to do with toys. Chase them? Bop them with his nose? Carry them off to chew? Well, he\u0027ll just give his people some play bows. Dalton is getting along well with his foster dog buddy and did so with two little dogs in a previous foster home. He\u0027s very well behaved when left home alone in his pen, and is house-trained. This sweet boy is looking for a calm home, ideally one with a yard to roam. Come see if this sweet boy is right for yours! Follow Dalton\u0027s Instagram @adopt_dalton"

    "description": "Perla is the Audrey Hepburn of dogs - beautiful, graceful, poised, and full of class (also - she never takes a bad picture!). Upon meeting her, you can\u0027t help but stare at her beautiful, soulful eyes. Her adorable perky ears and infectious smile light up every room she walks into. Perla LOVES treats, maybe more than anything! She still waits patiently for them and takes them politely from your hand. She\u0027s a great candidate to learn a few cool tricks; she already knows \"sit, \"stay, \"come, and \"lay down. Perla enjoys the company of people and loves to curl up on the couch or at the foot of the bed and relax with you. Perla is housebroken, crate trained, and very well-behaved in a home environment. She likes squeaky toys, fetch, and scent games. She also loves to stare out the window and watch the world. Although she enjoys a quiet, relaxing time at home, Perla has also enjoyed many adventures with her previous foster home - kayaking, hiking, and exploring a small jungle (just like Audrey Hepburn!)."

    "description": "Danali is a very special little girl. Danali came to Austin Pets Alive! as a 4 month old puppy. Danali was found pulling herself down a busy road by a good Samaritan. The good Samaritan took her to the Austin Animal Center where she was seen by their vets immediately. Radiographs were taken which showed a pellet in her spinal cord at her T-11. A surgery was attempted to remove the pellet but the damage to the spine was already done and the risk for infection was not warranted since the spinal damage was permanent. She is currently unable to move her back legs due to the pellet lodged in her back and is also incontinent due to the paralysis in the back legs. Despite this, she has an amazing spirit and makes everyone around her smile when they meet her. Danali has learned to walk with a wheelchair and gets to sport the cutest diapers ever when out in public. Danali is very independent. She is able to army crawl her way out of the doggy door in her foster home. She needs to be with other dog-social dogs as they encourage her to use her front legs for play and also help stimulate her. Danali sleeps in an x-pen over night, is very dog and kitten social, is used to being carried everywhere she goes, and has never met a stranger she doesn\u0027t love. She often makes people swoon to her and when she encounters a group of people she requires that each member of the group, 2 and 4 legged, say hello to her. This cutie has completed water therapy and attends playgoup at the shelter when she comes to work with her foster mom. When she is tired she quickly puts herself to sleep in her bed in the office or in her x-pen at home. If you want your heart warmed daily by an animal that has pure love for life and you, then Danali is your girl! If interested in Danali please send an email to [email protected] detailing both your experience with disabled dogs and why you feel your family is a good fit for Danali. Any inquiries not including this information will not receive a response."

    "description": "Don\u0027t let the white whiskers fool you! This playful pup is full of life and ready to show you a good time! This fun-loving six-year-old has plenty of energy and loves entertaining himself with tennis balls and going on long walks with his human friends. It doesn\u0027t take long for Pete too warm up to people people - especially if you have treats. When he leans up against you, it\u0027s official - you\u0027ve got a friend for life. Since he\u0027s a fan of snacks, he\u0027s highly trainable and loves working on his skills. He\u0027s already mastered a number of skills, including \"sit,\" \"stay,\" and \"shake.\" Though he\u0027s a mid-sized retriever, Pete is convinced he\u0027s a lap dog. Once he snuggles up with you, get ready for some sloppy kisses. It\u0027s hard not to laugh when he channels his inner puppy and goes into full playtime mode. It\u0027s time for Pete to find his forever home, where he will undoubtedly make his family very happy. He appears to be potty trained and could potentially go home to a well-matched doggie sibling. So what do you say? Why not visit Pete today? We dare you not to fall in love at first kiss!"

    "description": "Murphy is a true go-getter. He\u0027s very smart and very athletic. He\u0027s not just interviewing to be your dog; he\u0027s interviewing for a job. Whether patrolling your yard for varmints, keeping you safe out on the trails or learning to run obstacle courses, Murphy is happiest when he\u0027s got something to do. Murphy is house trained, knows sit, and walks well on a leash. He is very protective of his home and the people he loves, so he can be a bit aloof when meeting strangers. He wants to decide for himself if you are friend or foe. But once he decides you are a friend, he\u0027s ride or die. He\u0027s as loyal as they come. If you\u0027re interested in getting into some sporting dog competitions, or if you\u0027re a regular exerciser looking for a partner, or maybe have a large piece of property in need of protecting, Murphy would love to meet you. He\u0027s got a five-year plan, a can-do attitude, and he can start immediately."

    "description": "Roy is a sassy boy who\u0027s always ready to play tug-o-war with his foster dog buddie and doing excited zoomies around the house. He\u0027d even like to play with those cats he\u0027s so fascinated with. Roy\u0027s a young pup,, but he\u0027s already overcoming a difficult earlier life, having been found in a trap. He came to foster care shy and somewhat fearful on first meeting new humans, but he\u0027s already accepting being held, petted and snuggled with his head on his person\u0027s shoulder. Roy is well-behaved, loves being in his crate and he\u0027s making good progress on his house training. He\u0027d love to find a home with people that will give him plenty of love and time to adjust to new surroundings. And one with a dog and cat to play with would be ideal. Come meet this adorable boy!"

    "description": "He is Sam! Sam is a happy, healthy dog in the prime of life. He\u0027d love to meet his new family and become a long-term companion. Sam can take a few minutes to warm up to new faces. We know the feeling. But once he knows and trusts you, he truly is man\u0027s (or woman\u0027s) best friend. We\u0027re wondering how his tail is still attached, with all the wagging it does every time he spies his favorite volunteers. After he feels comfortable he loves to come up for some petting. Sam has a medium energy level. He definitely enjoys a good romp now and then, but he also likes to get in plenty of beauty sleep. We think Sam would do best in a home with adults or with older children. He\u0027ll definitely benefit from a family who can provide him with both mental and physical stimulation and ongoing training. He promises to make the learning fun for everyone! Sam is a good playmate for most dogs. If you\u0027ve already got a dog in your home, we\u0027d be happy to introduce them to make sure they would be compatible housemates. But Sam isn\u0027t just a good-time Charlie. He\u0027s shown himself to be a smart dog and knows all of his basic commands. Often he\u0027ll ask you for instructions by waving his paws at you. Sam is in the Total Obedience Program. The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modelled after the AKC\u0027s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Sam has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help him learn the skills to become the best dog he can be! He is learning skills like sit and down, walking nicely on leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers or other dogs, staying in a sit or down until told \"free,\" and coming when called. Once Sam successfully completes all the skills on his training plan he will be considered TOP Dog Ready! Sam is working hard to become a wonderful pet and as a part of APA\u0027s Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with Sam after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA\u0027s CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https://vimeo.com/89434193"

    "description": "Eli is really good at being a dog. He does all the dog stuff. He is truly excellent at playing fetch. He\u0027ll bring it right back to you and drop the ball right in your hand. You don\u0027t have to wrestle it out of his mouth or anything. He already makes an excellent trail runner/jogging partner. He chases cats, just a little, but what full blooded dog doesn\u0027t? He loves to get pets. He loves to sniff things. He loves to wag his tail and look adoringly at you. You know, dog stuff. Eli is house and crate-trained, and considering his immense talent in playing fetch, could likely be taught many other things. If you\u0027re looking for a tiny dog you can put in your bag and take to brunch, keep looking. But if you\u0027re looking for the full dog experience, if you want to run and jump and sniff, then you can\u0027t do better then Eli. Come meet him!"

Cuddling may be her favorite thing, whether it\u0027s with her doggie friends or her people. She also loves her human friends, jumping high with excitement when they come home, then climbing all over them for kisses. Now in foster care, Ginger is off to a good start on her crate, house and leash-training and is learning to sit for treats. She\u0027s an active, energetic girl who loves her chew toys, and after playtime is up, she\u0027s ready to snuggle under the warm covers. This sweet girl is ready to move on to her forever home. Come meet her and see if yours is the one."

    "description": "Skippy aspires to be a Velcro boy, sticking closely to his human friends at all times - in your lap, on the couch, or even on the floor at your feet. He just loves to love on you and be loved on back. This sweet boy came from a home where he was neglected and mistreated, but he isn\u0027t holding it against his new friends. He just wants to move on to a new and better life with new and better people. Plus, he loves playing with other dogs and toys, and he has paid no attention to cats he\u0027s met. Skippy has fun showing off his charming, lovable personality, doing his puppy bounding, flopping on the floor and wriggling on his back. Then this smartie is ready to learn in exchange for those yummy treats, or even just praise from his humans. He already answers to \u0027sit,\u0027 \u0027shake\u0027 and \u0027down.\u0027 He\u0027s a wonderful walker on his leash. And on sleepovers, he has been well behaved when left alone, has slept through the night, and has proved to be house trained. Skippy is ready for a home where he can play and cuddle with those human and doggie companions he loves. Come meet him and see if yours is the home he\u0027s ready to move to."

    "description": "Buddha is all about love. He will come over to where you\u0027re sitting to give you a body hug and kisses. It\u0027ll make your day! He does great in the home and is already crate-trained. Buddha loves to fetch and will even bring the ball right back to you. Squeaky toys are his kryptonite and can keep him busy for awhile. His mega-watt smile catches people\u0027s attention when he walks around the neighborhood. He\u0027s an adventurer, enjoying the sights and sounds around him. He can be a chill, yet curious dude. His favorite past time is to observe people passing by. He\u0027s treat motivated and will follow you around with big puppy eyes in case you would like to share a yummy morsel. That should make teaching him new skills pretty easy. He already knows sit and is easy to leash up. Buddha is ready to be someone\u0027s best friend and companion. Give him a chance to be yours!"

    "description": "Sage is an easy going, lovable, snuggle bug! She is an amazing companion and cannot wait to prove it to her forever family! She\u0027s housetrained and actually likes her crate. She seems to feel safe and cozy in her kennel space and her foster reports she isn\u0027t destructive at all. She\u0027s still working on her leash skills but is eager to learn and very trainable. She is quickly learning commands and has already mastered \"sit, \"out, \"inside, and \"off. Obedience really seems to be her middle name and she truly is a sponge when it comes to learning. Sage has a very gentle temperament and does magnificently around other dogs - she is submissive yet confident around them. She loves to play and run around with her doggy playmates and gets very sad when she sees others playing and she isn\u0027t participating. She definitely prefers interactive play instead of toys. This lovable lady adores her people and is attentive to their every move. She will adorably match her person\u0027s energy level and will follow them around like a shadow. Sage quickly understands boundaries and always respects the house rules once she knows them. She\u0027s also the kissing queen and belly scratches put her on cloud 9! She has a hilarious snort she makes when she\u0027s excited that\u0027s guaranteed to put a smile on your face! She is content to snuggle calmly next to you and really just wants to be loved. Sage\u0027s foster raves that she\u0027s the most respectful, well-rounded, caring pooch. She really is a complete gem. Her ideal home would have another dog sibling for her to play with - she really thrives with that companionship. Come meet Sage! She will show you just how devoted she is to loving you!"

He is super treat-motivated and he will be easy to train. Stop by APA! today to meet Bullet G, you may end up bringing him home!"

    "description": "In a word, Moose is magnificent! Just look at him and you\u0027ll see he\u0027s a sight to behold. This big lug of a dog has captured the hearts of many ladies here at the shelter. With his movie star good looks and strong, silent demeanor, it\u0027s easy to see how he became such a heartthrob! Good looks aside, Moose has so much to offer. Like James Dean, he\u0027s a bit stoic, but it won\u0027t take long for him to warm up and nuzzle you with that jowly face. He morphs into a puppy when he\u0027s chasing his toys or taking a dip in the pool. His two passions in life are fetch and swimming. So if you\u0027re looking for an athletic, fun-loving guy, Moose is it! If you\u0027re a lover of the great outdoors, Moose is your perfect fit. He is a great walking and running companion. He goes out with his Virtual Foster friend every night for evening walks around the ball field. He\u0027s a gentleman on the leash and is learning some new skills. He\u0027s eager to please and will work hard for treats! Also, we should note that he appears to be potty trained and could potentially live in a home with a well-matched pup. So what do you say? Why not stop by APA today and see for yourself how much our Magnificent Moose has to offer?"

    "description": "If you have time to cuddle all day long, Tyson wants to move into your home. This sweet boy is shy with new acquaintances, but soon opens up. He\u0027s an affectionate people dog whose favorite activity is laying next to his people, head on their laps, and snuggling. His other favorite things are zooming in circles around the yard or going for walks on his leash. Oh, and getting belly rubs. Tyson is a calm, low-key boy who, when left alone, is happy to lay about in his armchair all day, causing no problems. He also loves car rides and sunning himself in the yard. He\u0027s crate-trained and seems house-trained. Previously in foster care, Tyson proved to be wonderful with other dogs, and very friendly with his foster dog buddy. He doesn\u0027t do well with cats, although not for the normal reason - he\u0027s very afraid of them. He also needs a child-free home. Tyson can display some fearfulness, so he\u0027ll benefit from owners who can help build his confidence. He will be a wonderful, quiet, well-behaved companion. A backyard to run, play and relax in will be a bonus. Come visit this sweet-natured boy."

    "description": "Thaddeus is an older gentlemen, but you can see he still has a youthful spirit. Not a sporting spirit though - he\u0027s pretty much just here for the naps and bully sticks. But a sparkle in his eye, a winning smile and a willingness to meet new friends. Thaddeus loves meeting people and always greets them gently and politely. For as much as he loves treats, he is sure to take those gently too. There is not too much Type A in his personality. He loves to go on walks and is great on leash. He is well-behaved in the home and knows how to use a doggie door. He is not super cuddly but he will occasionally lay his head in your lap. And don\u0027t be terribly surprised if you find he\u0027s crawled into bed with you in the middle of the night. Although he spends most of his time napping, he\u0027s still up for some leisurely adventures at the lake or park. He\u0027s a great swimmer. Thaddeus is the ultimate low-maintenance dog. Super chill, but still fun to hang out with, he\u0027s just looking for a comfy couch and some good friends. Is there room in your heart and living room?"

    "description": "Falafel is a bright eyed, bushy tailed little fellow who will tail wag his way into your heart. He is a sensitive soul and can be a bit shy, but once he gets to know you, he\u0027ll be rolling around on the floor asking for belly rubs and pawing at your leg to see if you have a treat to give him. Falafel is a medium energy pup who loves going for walks, does great in the car, loves playing with other dogs, big and small, and will happily snuggle up in a cozy bed of his own or with you. He seems like the kind of pup that would love his own special blanket or toy - a little Linus and a little Snoopy! Why not come on down and meet this sweet, brown eyed pup and see if he is the right fit for you!"

    "description": "From Thomas\u0027 foster: \"Thomas is an amazing dog who loves people and other dogs! This adorable pup loves to go for walks and runs, then pass out cuddled up to his house mate. Kisses you ask? Thomas is very affectionate with every member of our family, from our 9 year old son to our 9 month old other dog. He\u0027s house broken and uses the doggy door like a pro! One must are peanut butter dog treats, his absolute favorite!! He knows \"sit and will sit politely for his food. He\u0027s gone to stay with a sitter with multiple other dogs, all ages and sizes, and gets along with everyone!! Thomas would be a great addition for a family with children and other dogs.\""

    "description": "Jasmine is sweet, cuddly and playful like a puppy. With her big paws and a goofy little trot, she thinks she\u0027s a 60 pound lap dog. At home, Jasmine is quiet, affectionate and extremely treat-motivated, which makes training easy. Jasmine\u0027s a curious pup and follows her human around the house so she can be in the same room as them. She is always up for anything and especially loves car rides and napping on the couch with her human. She is completely house-trained and does extremely well in the crate when she\u0027s home alone. And she is very patient and affectionate with older children. Jasmine is a really special and loving pup and will provide a lifetime of love and loyalty."

    "description": "Lata loves a lotta cuddling. And a lotta belly rubs and ear scratches. And to be fair, in return she\u0027s happy to give a lotta kisses to her human friends. This very affectionate girl rates an 11 on the 10 cuddling scale. She wants to be in her person\u0027s lap, preferably all the time. But if there are limitations, she\u0027s also happy to go for walks, and she does well on leash. Now in foster care, she currently isn\u0027t living with other dogs, but her previous shelter reports that she gets along well with them. And she loves playing with kids. This easygoing, mellow girl just wants a home where she can get those belly rubs and laps to cuddle in. Come meet her and see if she\u0027s perfect for your lap."

They spent years romping the streets together in Kansas City before coming to APA! and once Miss Dee was adopted without Mr.Rogers and escaped within hours to get back to her love. Their Romeo and Juliet love story has convinced us that they must be adopted together! Mr. Rogers is a goofy, clumsy guy who will win you over with his awkward body and sweet personality. He loves to be brushed and to dog pile snuggle with Miss Dee. He protects Miss Dee and looks out for her in every situation. He just loves her so! Miss Dee and Mr. Rogers would do best in a household where they are the only dogs. They are searching for someone who will love them both. If their love story inspires you, drop by our Tarrytown Location to meet these lovebirds."

    "description": "Miss Dee is a lovely lady who is shy at first but will open up with the right amount of love and treats. Once she trust you, she will come to you and paw you for attention. There\u0027s only one thing Miss Dee loves more than affection...her husband Mr.Rogers. Miss Dee and Mr.Rogers roamed the streets of Kansas City for years before they made their way to APA! Miss Dee was even adopted out once without Mr. Rogers and broke free within hours to make her way back to her love. Their Romeo and Juliet love story has made us decide they must be adopted together! Mr. Rogers is a calm and protective guy, who would do anything to guaranteed Miss Dee is okay. This lovely couple is looking for a home without any other dogs so they can be the center of attention. If their love story has inspired you, stop by our Tarrytown location to see their love for yourself."

    "description": "It\u0027s possible that Daisy is living indoors in a home for the first time in her life, and she\u0027s adapting very well to it! This calm, low-key lady is a sweetheart who wants to be near her new human friends, sitting with them on the couch or by their feet, and occasionally asking for a pet or belly rub. She\u0027s also learning what toys are about, and has decided on squeaky plushies as her favorite. She also likes doing short zoomies in the yard, although she\u0027s recovering from a back leg injury that\u0027s currently slowing her down. Then when she\u0027s back inside, she\u0027s happy to snooze in her crate. Daisy is getting along well with her foster Chihuahua buddy, is making good progress on leash walking and house-training and already answers to the \u0027sit\u0027 command. This patient, un-demanding and well-behaved pup will be a wonderful companion to a family or a single person. She loves all people of any age and promises to give her heart and soul to anyone who returns her love. Come meet this sweetie."

    "description": "Are you looking for an easy-going, intelligent dog with the world\u0027s most magnificent ears? Well look no further than Jazzy! She really is the best of both worlds--a couch potato in the house and an intrepid explorer on the trail! Whether you\u0027re in the mood for curling up with a good book on a lazy Sunday afternoon or taking a stroll around the park, Jazzy will happily stay by your side. This middle-aged dog is young at heart, and is currently impressing her hosts in an APA foster home. We think she would be a great match for a moderately active home where she can continue to receive some exercise and a lot of love. Around the house, Jazzy is an affectionate cuddler. She gets in plenty of lazing around, preferably near (or on top of) her favorite people. She is a good walking partner, and might even be up an occasional jog. While she was at the shelter, she became a RuffTail Runner favorite, meaning she gets out on the busy trail on a regular basis for some outdoorsy adventures. She was also a popular girl in playgroup, playing nicely with her fellow shelter dogs in a big play yard. She also likes to wrestle with rope and squeaky toys Give this lady a chance to learn the rules of the house, and she\u0027ll make a happy addition to your family. Of all her great qualities, you\u0027ll love the way she lights up when she sees you. She has a special way of luring you in with a look that says,\"Want to go have some fun?\" Consider meeting Jazzy today so you can see how much she has to offer!"

    "description": "Kylie has stolen her foster mom\u0027s heart and we\u0027re pretty sure she will steal yours too. She\u0027s described as \"obedient, loving, gentle, smart and a great companion with drive to learn new things. She sounds wonderful doesn\u0027t she? While Kylie would prefer a home of her own without other animal siblings, she would adore two legged siblings as she seems to really love kids. She knows lots of commands and gently takes treats when they are offered. Oh and lest we not forget this important fact, she is fully house-trained! She has been given free roam at her foster home and when they are away she naps on the sofa building up her energy for that playtime when they return. This girl wants to have fun too. She loves tennis ball fetch and she brings the ball back over and over and even drops it for you to toss again. She doesn\u0027t discriminate against other toys and will bring her whole toy box over and dump it so she can find her very favorite for that moment. Though she is active and playful, she also loves belly rubs and cuddles and is very calm when its time for the love part of the day. She\u0027s a great sized, not too big and not too small...she\u0027s just right! Kylie also enjoys learning new things and is in the Total Obedience Program. The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modeled after the AKC\u0027s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Kylie has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help her learn the skills to become the best dog she can be! She is learning skills like sit and down, walking nicely on leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers or other dogs, staying in a sit or down until told \"free,\" as well as \u0027place\u0027 (running-to and staying-in a designated spot) and coming when called. Once Kylie successfully completes all the skills on her training plan she will be considered TOP Dog Ready! Kylie is working hard to become a wonderful pet and as a part of APA\u0027s Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with Kylie after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA\u0027s CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https://vimeo.com/89434193 Kylie is ready to move on to her forever home and she\u0027s hoping you or you and your family are to be hers really soon. Come meet her today!"

    "description": "When you look into Lincoln\u0027s eyes, you can tell that he\u0027s a special boy. He looks beefy and tough on the outside, but he\u0027s a sensitive soul and would love more than anything for someone to come along and show him how safe and loving the world can be. Lincoln is happiest during a game of fetch and also loves chewing on rope toys. His face lights up when he knows you\u0027re about to throw a toy for him! Are you interested in working with your dog to teach him or her skills? If so, Lincoln is your man. He really loves working and training. His \"sit\" game is on point, too, and he has been known to sit no matter how many distractions are around him. Lincoln has won over several APA! staffers and volunteers who know how much he deserves a loving home and can\u0027t wait to see him flourish there! Could that home be yours? Come meet this loveable beefcake today!"

    "description": "Banner was named after the Hulk because of his studly exterior, but it turns out he\u0027s smart and sweet and more like Bruce himself. He may come off like the strong silent type, but once he trusts you he\u0027s nothing but a big goofy teddy bear. This boy loves head scratches and belly rubs, and his kisses rank with the best of them. His smile lights up a room - there\u0027s no way not to be happy when this boy is happy! Banner is house-trained and is learning basic commands like sit and shake. He is getting better on a leash all the time, and comes when called. He\u0027s left home alone at his foster\u0027s house and does great! With proper introductions, Banner loves to romp around with doggy friends before curling up with a good bone. Banner also does well with kids, but would probably do best with older kids who can handle his size (he thinks he\u0027s a lap dog) and understand that he needs some time to warm up. Banner\u0027s past is unknown, but his future is bright! He just needs people who will show him that the world is as loving as he is."

    "description": "Luna is a very mellow, sweet girl who\u0027s all about cuddling with her humans. A bit of a Velcro pup, Luna wants to curl up next to her people on the couch or bed, getting lots of belly rubs. And she also likes being with other dogs, unafraid of those even much bigger than she is. Luna walks well on leash and also does well in her crate, and is making progress on her house-training. She does have a heart murmur, but it\u0027s easily managed with meds. A calm, affectionate lady, Luna is looking for a home where she can nap peacefully and snuggle with her person. A small apartment would work well, too. Come meet this adorable girl!"

    "description": "Not only does Herbert have the personality, he\u0027s also got the looks. His foster mom loves his sweet face and soft, \"smooshable body. As she says, \"he looks like a stuffed animal made of velvet. While 4-year-old Herbert may seem like a wise, calm old man on the surface, he\u0027ll surprise you with his excitement for the world and bursts of energy. But when he doesn\u0027t have a case of the zoomies, Herbert is training to be a TOP dog. He\u0027s a very good student, and he\u0027s quickly learning all of the TOP dog commands. The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modeled after the AKC\u0027s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Herbert has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help him learn the skills to become the best dog he can be! He is learning skills like sit and down, walking nicely on leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers or other dogs, staying in a sit or down until told \"free,\" and coming when called. Once Herbert successfully completes all the skills on his training plan he will be considered TOP Dog Ready! Herbert is working hard to become a wonderful pet and as a part of APA\u0027s Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with Herbert after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA\u0027s CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https://vimeo.com/89434193 As a Hurricane Harvey rescue, Herbert been through a lot. In return for giving him a loving home, he promises to give you more love and laughs than you can imagine."

    "description": "I am the most perfect-est doggy in the whole wide world! At least that is what my human friends at the shelter say about me. They comment on how sweet and affectionate I am with people, how well I do with dogs of all sizes, and say that I am potty trained. I briefly lived in a home with kids and was a total love bug. I first came to APA! about 4 years ago. I was adopted by a nice lady who took care of me over the years but unfortunately she found herself unable to provide a good home for me and had to return me to the shelter. I was really sad for a couple of days but happy to see my old human friends at APA!. It has been fun to see familiar faces here but I am ready to get adopted again by someone wonderful so we can go on walks together and cuddle under blankies on the couch. Are you looking for the perfect doggy, \u0027cause here I am!"

    "description": "At first glance, it might appear that Monty is channeling his inner Eeyore. With those soulful puppy dog eyes and that prominent underbite, he has a way of pulling at our heartstrings. But don\u0027t be fooled! This fun-loving boy is all wiggles and wags when he\u0027s playing with toys or exploring the great outdoors. Runners and hikers, take note! if you\u0027re looking for the perfect trail companion, Monty is your boy. He goes out on the trail on a regular basis with his Virtual Foster friend. Together, they run side-by-side for miles. Bikers, strollers, dogs, cranky swans and other distractions don\u0027t phase him in the slightest. He truly is a fabulous workout buddy! So if you\u0027re looking for an athletic, sweet-natured, handsome boy, why not go the full Monty? If that face isn\u0027t enough to convince you to take him home immediately, we should also note that he has received rave reviews from his sleepover friend. He proved to be potty trained and a respectful houseguest. He\u0027s also an excellent snoozer and is content to lounge on the couch and keep you company for hours during Netflix marathons. In addition to being a top-notch lounger and trail companion, Monty is also in the Total Obedience Program. The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modelled after the AKC\u0027s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Monty has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help him learn the skills to become the best dog he can be! He is learning skills like sit and down, walking nicely on leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers or other dogs, staying in a sit or down until told \"free,\" and coming when called. Once Monty successfully completes all the skills on his/her training plan he will be considered TOP Dog Ready! Monty is working hard to become a wonderful pet and as a part of APA\u0027s Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with Monty after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA\u0027s CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https://vimeo.com/89434193 So what do you say? Want to come visit this sweet boy today? We have no doubt he will make his forever family very happy one day! Follow Monty on Instagram @ adopt_montythepit https://www.instagram.com/adopt_montythepit/?hl\u003den"
