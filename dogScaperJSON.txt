    "description": "Warren Hood is better known as Fennec by his foster - like a Fennec Fox! This adorable dog with the magical ears has come a long way to get where he is today. Fennec is a lover of humans, cuddles, play time, and zoomies. He somehow manages to combine gorgeous athleticism with endearing awkwardness. He\u0027ll soar through the air in a game of chase but toss him a ball and he\u0027s like that infamous video of a retriever missing the treat catch in hilarious slow motion. Awkward catching skills or no, he\u0027s quite a smartypants who learns quickly and enjoys showing off his puzzle toy solving skills. Fennec is now putting those smarts to work as part of Dogs Out Loud, a training program to help shelter dogs meet their full potential. He is kicking some serious tushy on his training goals and building himself quite a fan club along the way. Fennec has been saved twice from shelter euthanasia, no easy feat for a sensitive bully breed boy. He\u0027s hoping his luck holds and takes him all the way home to stay this time! To learn more about Fennec or set up a time to meet him, email [email protected]!"

    "description": "Mickey is a fabulous walker on his leash, eager for neighborhood walks. And he likes playing with soft toys and is fun to watch as he zooms around the play yard. He\u0027d love access to a little pool for some happy splashing. He is good at leaving cats alone, and even seems a little scared of them. Mickey will be a great addition to an adult-only home, where his people can take him for walks, chill on the couch with him and let him be their adorable watchdog. Mickey plays very well the dogs in his playgroup, if sometimes rowdy with smaller dogs. He just wants to be in charge of the group, so he\u0027s happiest when his playmates are on the submissive side, big or small. He currently lives with three larger dogs and enjoys thinking he is the boss of them. He\u0027s somewhat the opposite with humans. He\u0027s fearful with strangers and can be nippy with people he doesn\u0027t know and trust, especially children who approach his kennel. He prefers females over males, but can warm up to males. He needs to have a human who isn\u0027t afraid of him and understands how to handle his \"naughty\" behavior. But once he gets well acquainted and comfortable, he becomes his human friend\u0027s cuddle buddy, happy to hang out by his person\u0027s side, or even in her lap. He can be a loyal little guard dog, ready to alert his person to any evil that might be lurking. He is always alert, and may do best in a non-apartment home. Come meet this little guy today!"

    "description": "Shamrock is a toy lover. And if you wonder what his favorite toys are, it\u0027s your dirty socks and underwear! Shamrock is restarting his life. He was found downtown in a box and was practically skin and bones. Since he\u0027s been in foster care, he\u0027s gained weight and although he\u0027s a low-energy boy, he loves to play and even do zoomies around the house. Then he\u0027ll ask to come up on the couch for a snuggle. He really gets energetic when his foster mom comes home from work, wagging his entire body and giving little kisses. And he\u0027s especially happy if he sees a new toy to play tug-o-war with. Speaking of playing, he loves his female chihuahua housemate and tries to get her to play all the time. Shamrock is crate and house trained, and freely roams his apartment when his mom is away with no problems. He has been diagnosed with diabetes, which is managed with easy-to-give daily insulin shots that he takes like a trooper. He does enjoy car rides and looking out the window as the world goes by. A home with a small yard where Shamrock could snooze and sunbathe would be a bonus. But he\u0027ll welcome any home where he can get the love and care he wants and needs. Come meet this special boy!"

If she has a choice between a ball or a new friendly person to beg for bellyrubs, she will agonize over it for a few moments, then usually chooses the belly rubs. And if she can get some playtime in water, even better. She has been labeled the \"Mermaid of Lady Bird Lake\" as she can be spotted at this watering hole on a sunny day, swimming the day away. Marilla\u0027s default assumption when meeting new people is that they are new best friends. She cannot get close enough to people and will wind herself all around you trying to get as many body parts touching as possible. Marilla also enjoys learning new things and is in the Total Obedience Program (TOP), which is modeled after the AKC\u0027s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Marilla has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help her learn the skills to become the best dog she can be! She is learning skills like sit and down, walking nicely on leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers or other dogs, staying in a sit or down until told \"free,\" and coming when called. Once Marilla successfully completes all the skills on her training plan she will be considered TOP Dog Ready! Marilla is working hard to become a wonderful pet and as a part of APA\u0027s Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with Marilla after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA\u0027s CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https://vimeo.com/89434193"

    "description": "Sparky is a sparkler of a boy and, really, just a giant lovebug who\u0027s pretty sure he\u0027s a lapdog. This sweet boy\u0027s foster says he\u0027s one of \"the most cuddly dogs I\u0027ve ever been around.\" He loves to lay his head in his person\u0027s lap and let his head be stroked. Then he\u0027ll want to struggle on the bed or couch - but he\u0027s also willing to go off on his own. Sparky has occasional bursts of energy, but he is mostly a calm, well-mannered boy who walks well on his leash. He\u0027s crate trained, seems house trained and answers to the \"sit\" and \"come\" commands. And he\u0027s working on \"stay.\" When he\u0027s in a playful mood, Sparky loves to play with his squeaky toys and he\u0027s happy when his human throws the toy or plays tug-o-war. Sometimes he\u0027ll fetch the toy, but mostly he runs with it and throws it for himself. Sparky will be a wonderful addition to a home where he can be a companion for an owner who wants to give him love, snuggles and long walks with lots of time for sniffing. Come mee this boy!"

    "description": "Chubbs is a dog who is in love with life. He adores chasing balls, exploring his world when out for a walk or run, and then settling down for all kinds of cuddling and love. He\u0027s not above telling you that you are not nearly finished with the belly rubs should you stop too soon! Chubbs is a people-pleasing ball full of love. He should take to training easily and is going to want to be an active participant in the life of his forever family. He has shown appropriate interest in other dogs he meets. He\u0027s a strong, athletic boy who would likely be a great running, hiking or walking buddy but will happily run off a lot of energy chasing those balls. He loves playing fetch and is quite talented at it. If you would like to play and cuddle to your heart\u0027s content with an appreciative, happy, goofy, adorable wonderful young dog who would like nothing more than to be yours forever, please come meet Chubbs real soon!"

    "description": "There\u0027s something about black dogs. Though they are beautiful, they tend to get overlooked in the shelter. But if you could take a moment and visit Loki, you\u0027ll see that he is a total love-bug. He has that look that says, \"Want to have some fun together?\" Once you get him leashed up and out the door, he is full of life! He can lope around the ball fields with a big, goofy grin! No matter what he\u0027s doing, he seems very proud of himself as he struts his stuff. His true joyful nature comes out when he\u0027s outside having fun. His other favorite hobby is loving up on his humans. He is a very affectionate cuddlebug. He loves being around his favorite people, giving them kisses, cuddling on their laps and spooning in bed with them. He brings toys to his human friends for playtime, plays tug-o-war, chases tennis balls, and then does zoomies in the yard. He\u0027s a smart, treat motivated boy who already answers to a host of hand signal commands - including \"sit,\" \"lay down\" and \"shake.\" And he\u0027s crate-trained and seems house trained and is great in the car. If you\u0027ve got treats, he\u0027s willing to learn new tricks. Loki is a loving, loyal boy will be eager to please an active family and who can give him the affection he wants and will return in abundance. If that\u0027s not incentive enough, his adoption fee is paid. Won\u0027t you come visit him today? Please check out his Instagram @adoptloki.apa to learn more about Loki!"

    "description": "There\u0027s just something about Chewy! When this short little sausage roll struts by with his ears bouncing, tail wagging, hips swaying, and a tennis ball or his favorite Lamb Chop toy in his mouth, everyone he passes has to smile and maybe even laugh...it really is impossible not to. This \"Chewy Effect is also transmitted through a camera - don\u0027t believe us? We dare you to look at his pictures and video without smiling or feeling a warm, fuzzy feeling in your heart. Chewy is a delight and has quite the fan base at the shelter. His passion and skill for fetching are known far and wide - he dares you to tell him he\u0027s a senior pup! In between fetching sessions, he\u0027s been known to plop down on the floor and roll the ball back and forth to you with his nose. Not only is Chewy housebroken, a comedian, and a stellar athlete...he\u0027s also a scholar. Chewy enjoys learning new things and is in the Total Obedience Program. The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modelled after the AKC\u0027s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Chewy has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help him learn the skills to become the best dog he can be! Chewy is learning skills like sit and down, walking nicely on leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers or other dogs, staying in a sit or down until told \"free,\" and coming when called. Once Chewy successfully completes all the skills on his training plan he will be considered TOP Dog Ready! Chewy is working hard to become a wonderful pet and as a part of APA\u0027s Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with Chewy after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA\u0027s CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https://vimeo.com/89434193 Come play a round of fetch with Chewy, so you can witness the Chewy Effect and the joy it brings in person! You can also follow Chewy on Instagram (yeah, he\u0027s that cool...) https://www.instagram.com/adopt_chewy/"

    "description": "Brasco has made an exciting discovery - those tennis balls are really fun to chase. So he brings them back and drops at his person\u0027s feet on command so he can fetch them all over again. This happy, bouncy boy loves to romp and play. And outdoors he loves to explore with many, many sniffs. And then he wants to be with his human friends, getting as close to them as possible, curling his entire body against them. Brasco has lived with kids in the past. He walks well on his leash, seems crate trained and is reported to be house trained. And he\u0027s a gentle taker of those treats he loves.

    "description": "Galaxy is APA\u0027s version of Princess Leia with eyes that sparkle brighter than stars in the sky when she sees the people she loves. This affectionate, sometimes goofy girl can be shy when first meeting new humans, but once she gets comfortably acquainted, she lights up and her personality shines. She loves, loves and loves her human friends and wants to cuddle with them, sneaking in kisses and curling up in their laps. Galaxy is happy to take walks and play with toys, then lay next to her people and ask for petting. And if it\u0027s been a while since you gave her a treat, she\u0027ll put her paw on your arm as a polite reminder. Galaxy has great leash skills and is crate and house trained. Quick to learn, Galaxy is in the Total Obedience Program. The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modeled after the AKC\u0027s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Galaxy has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help her learn the skills to become the best dog she can be! She is now TOP Dog Ready, which means she\u0027s already learned all the skills in her training plan, including sit and down, walking nicely on leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers, calmly walking past another dog, staying in a sit or down until told \"free,\" and coming when called. Galaxy has worked hard to become a wonderful pet and as a part of APA\u0027s Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with Galaxy after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA\u0027s CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https://vimeo.com/89434193 Come meet this girl with the cutest, most contagious smile and see if she can be part of your galaxy!"

    "description": "Kapoa is an incredibly sweet-natured boy. He\u0027s recovering from a leg injury, so he cannot engage in a lot of strenuous activity, but that\u0027s fine by him for now. It just means more time for cuddling! Kapoa loves playing fetch, enjoys his daily walks, and even waits at the door politely when it\u0027s time to go out. He already knows the \"sit\" command and is working on \"down\" and \"wait.\" And he\u0027s crate-trained - give him something to chew on and he is quiet and content. And he\u0027ll crack you up with his goofy sleeping positions. One of his best is on his back with his legs up in the air! Come meet this sweet boy today!"

    "description": "Whiskey has had a very eventful life. Rescued from an abusive situation as a puppy, and bounced around from shelter to shelter, he wants nothing more than to finally find his person. And when he does, he will provide them with boundless love, loyalty and affection. If you are looking for a ride or die kind of love, then you should consider Whiskey. Whiskey is house trained, and comfortable in a crate. Though he is not too keen on sharing his family with other dogs, outside of his home he loves to play. He can moderate his style appropriately, going from a ruff and tumble session with big dogs to a gentle nudge with smaller dogs. Though he loves a good romp, he is equally fond of naps and lounging on the couch. Really, being with his people is his favorite thing. He is up for anything, as long as you\u0027re there. You will have the ultimate protector in Whiskey, a dog who will guard against physical threats, and comfort you from the more existential ones. He\u0027s the type of dog who totally knows when you had a bad day, and will up his snuggle game accordingly. Whiskey is not for a casual dog owner. He is for someone who is looking for a soul mate. If you think you\u0027re in the market, you should come meet him."

    "description": "Fredrick has a sweet, bashful smile that sums up his entire being. He can act like a delicate wallflower when you first meet him, but once he is comfortable, he is all about being up in your personal space. He is a pro-level cuddler. Fredrick walks great on a leash. He has good manners and is very focused on his person. Which is fortunate, because taking walks is his favorite thing. He\u0027d rather do that than fetch or wrestle with other dogs. He would do best in a home with a yard, as he loves being outside. He\u0027d like to split his time equally between the grass and your lap, if he could. He learned sit, and has proven to be smart and eager to please. All you really need to fall in love with Fredrick is to look into his eyes. He just has the warmest, most soulful eyes. When he gives you a little hopeful tail wag, it\u0027ll be all over. If you\u0027re ready, come meet him!"

    "description": "Petunia is an easy going, playful love bug. Her current foster says her favorite thing to do is chase critters in the yard. She\u0027s always on a hunting excursion. She\u0027s also equally content to hang around close to her people and observe. Sweet Petunia loves to cuddle, and will gently ask for chin scratches, ear rubs, and belly pats. She does very well with other dogs, and seems to really like kids. She is an angel in her crate, walks wonderfully on her leash, and always comes when she\u0027s called. She doesn\u0027t bark much, and is an eager learner. She truly aims to please. Petunia does require a little TLC as she struggles with incontinence. She is on some prescription food that helps her out, and she\u0027s content to wear a diaper if that\u0027s a preference. It\u0027s pretty adorable too! There\u0027s nothing quite like the awesome greeting this girl will give her people when they get home! She\u0027s full of excitement! Her foster raves about her beautiful soulful eyes, and her cute \"1st position ballet dancer turned out legs. Petunia is such a wonderful companion, and is excited to find her forever family. She would love having other dog siblings, and would do well with kids in the home as well. She has so much love to give, and can\u0027t wait to have it so deservedly returned. Come meet this little lady! She\u0027ll win you over with her spunk!"

    "description": "Cane is a sugary-sweet boy and a gentle giant who\u0027s just lookin\u0027 for love. This dog-shaped marshmallow is a big softie with people. Do you want to cuddle, give belly rubs and get infinite kisses? Cane is your guy! He would love nothing more than to take naps at your feet, opening one eye from time to time to make sure you are doing well. Cane currently resides in a foster home, where he is adored. He is housetrained, and has been doing very well in his crate while waiting for his foster family to return home. One of his favorite activities is to take strolls around the neighborhood, and he reportedly has good leash manners. When at home, he enjoys chewing on a juicy bone while you watch your favorite Netflix show. Cane is ready to find a place he can call his own. Unconditional love, lots of tail wags when you\u0027re around and the joy of his company all come included with his adoption contract."

    "description": "We know, we know...Zoe is friggin\u0027 adorable. Yesssss, we also know she\u0027s tiny and scruffy and OMG you have to have her. We totally get all that. BUT.......... Here\u0027s the thing with Zoe, though: We don\u0027t think Zoe was born with all her marbles. Or, maybe she lost her marbles at a young age. What we\u0027re trying to say is that this adorable little fluffy-faced dog is, wellllll, let\u0027s just say she\u0027s \"unique\" in case she figures out how to read and gets her paws on this Bio (hey don\u0027t laugh, she\u0027s REALLY smart). Zoe has been happily ruling over, errr, we mean living in a Foster home since the beginning of the year. Based on what we\u0027ve learned about her, we do think the right home for this maniacal muppet exists. The rub, though, is that this home might very well not be you. Here\u0027s what we think purely the home dynamics need to look like: - Only one to two adults for the foreseeable future - No other pets for the foreseeable future - Friends, family, visitors that will actually LISTEN to you when you tell them how to act around your dog Don\u0027t get us wrong, Zoe has tons of positively delightful qualities. She is very energetic and loves to play, nails the whole \"going to the bathroom outside\" thing, is wicked smart (that might not actually ALWAYS be a positive, see above), and is super affectionate and snuggly. She also does this ridiculously cute dance where she stands up on two and waves her front arms together when she wants attention. We\u0027d post a video, but like, we don\u0027t really need MORE people clicking on her because of the whole \"looooook at how cute she is I just CAN\u0027T!\". I\u0027m sure by now you\u0027re wondering what exactly Zoe\u0027s deal is. It\u0027s complicated, OKAY. Rest assured, Zoe\u0027s foster Dad will give you all the nitty-gritty specifics if you are brave enough to write him. Still not sure if you\u0027re the right fit? Well you definitely need to be cool, calm, and collected around little dogs, even little dogs like Zoe that don\u0027t like sharing anything and are very particular about where and when you touch them. Sounds fun, right!? All kidding aside, Zoe is beloved by her foster parents, and for that really special someone that can learn (and be taught by us!) how to patiently overcome these obstacles and live with Zoe\u0027s challenges, she will truly be worth it."

    "description": "Like the dog detective, Scooby is the perfect sidekick. Smart, loyal and a skilled detective! Plus he\u0027s a little on the goofy side. He will look at you with his head tilt and adoring eyes. He moves through life like a happy, gangly pre-teen with some pretty hilarious and uncoordinated moments. Scooby has a zest for life that just makes you happy to be around him. Whether he\u0027s throwing a toy in the air, splashing around in a plastic pool, batting his eyelashes in an attempt to charm treats out of you, or falling off the couch while focusing too hard on the toy he\u0027s playing with, he lives his life to the fullest! He loves to run, play fetch, tug of war with his favorite rope toy and sit in the water. After playing hard, he will go right into the plastic pool or mud hole of your choosing. He loves to be outside in the warm sunshine and has a favorite big rock he likes to sit on. When he\u0027s not on the rock, he loves to snuggle and sit in your lap. He loves his people and will show his love with lots of kisses, lean in\u0027s and snuggles and will even sit on your lap if you let him! Scooby has spent some time in a home where he was potty and crate trained. He also seemed playful and easygoing around cats. Scooby has learned some basic commands and is a smart guy who seems eager to learn more...because he\u0027ll do anything for a treat! Scooby is also in the Total Obedience Program. The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modelled after the AKC\u0027s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Scooby has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help him learn the skills to become the best dog he can be! He is learning skills like sit and down, walking nicely on leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers or other dogs, staying in a sit or down until told \"free,\" and coming when called. Once Scooby successfully completes all the skills on his training plan he will be considered TOP Dog Ready! Scooby is working hard to become a wonderful pet and as a part of APA\u0027s Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with Scooby after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA\u0027s CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https://vimeo.com/89434193 Once you meet this flirtatious, charming and playful young guy, you will be saying Scooby Dooby Doo -- I love you!!"

    "description": "What\u0027s black-and-white and cute all over? Major, that\u0027s who! This big, fluffy lug is APA\u0027s biggest heartthrob. With that gorgeous coat and handsome grin, it\u0027s no wonder why he has so many lady friends. It also helps that he\u0027s a generous kisser and a total love-bug. When he\u0027s really feeling the love, he\u0027ll plop right down on your lap like a poodle. And if you\u0027re really lucky, he\u0027ll lean backwards for a big ol\u0027 sloppy kiss! Needless to say, Major is not shy about showing his affection. Nothing makes him happier than belly rubs, back massages and nonstop doting. On date night, he\u0027ll take you out for a moonlit stroll around the park, where he loves to sniff all the scents and splish-splash in the lake. It\u0027s hard not to laugh when he flops down onto the grass and rolls around with his feet flailing in the air. To maintain his boyish good looks, Major chases balls in the play yard and walks around the ball fields at a steady clip. The \"working dog\" in him always yearns for excitement, so he requires enrichment from his human friends. Whether you\u0027re in the mood for hiking, swimming, couch cuddling, Major is ready to join in on the fun! When he\u0027s exploring the great outdoors, Major is busy working on his skills and has already mastered several commands. If you\u0027ve got treats, he\u0027ll show you his tricks. He makes excellent eye contact and is always willing to show off his smarts. Prepare to be amazed when you break out the puzzle toys! This beautiful boy is ready for the loving forever home he so deserves. Could it be with you? Please consider meeting him today and seeing how much he has to offer!"

    "description": "Do you like to hit the snooze button a few times in the morning? Oscar does too! This cutie is happy to cuddle in bed until the late morning. He will also politely lounge around the house once he does get up, maybe chewing on a nice bone or stuffed toy. Don\u0027t let his lazy, homebody attitude fool you though. He is more than happy to join his human for a nice long walk or jog. He also loves swimming and wading in any body of water he can find. At the shelter, Oscar spends his time playing fetch and and going for walks with his favorite volunteers. He has also had lots of behavior training and likes to show off his great leash manners. He spent some time in a foster home where he has proven his love for sleep and snuggling, and impressed his friends by being crate trained and house trained! Oscar bonds closely with his humans. He may be able to live with another well-matched pup, and he seems to prefer the company of lady dogs. His biggest dream is a yard with his very own kiddie pool! Oscar is affectionate, silly, smart and eager to please. He also happens to be extremely adorable. He cannot wait to be living it up with a family of his own, one that will be dedicated to help him keep perfecting his skills!"

    "description": "Paloma is a very sweet girl who has shown herself to be quite easy in a home. She\u0027s a quiet companion, content to nap, cuddle and enjoy belly rubs. Paloma loves attention and affection. She has a silly side too, and will showcase her signature play bow and occasionally break out into a case of the zoomies. Paloma is housebroken and doesn\u0027t need to be crated, although she is crate trained. She can be left alone for hours and won\u0027t even get on the furniture, if not invited. Her foster mom has reported her to be a perfect house guest. Paloma is such a gentle girl and loves to lean in for pets. She\u0027s got the softest fur, especially right under her chin! Paloma is happiest with her person. She especially loves her walks and being outdoors and will go at a slow and steady pace; she\u0027s excellent on a leash. Paloma has a cancerous lump on her leg. While it doesn\u0027t slow her down or impede her abilities at all, it has been deemed inoperable, though we are looking into other options. But she requires no medication and she has no special needs. And despite her condition, our girl still has spunk! Paloma deserves a wonderful home and hopes to find one where she will give and receive much love and affection. Follow Paloma\u0027s Instagram @Paloma_eats_her_vegetables"

    "description": "Hey! Human! Guess what?! I love you! You know how I show it? Jumping really high and swiping at your face with my tongue! That\u0027s cool, right? Well, I\u0027m also working on my manners, so I won\u0027t do that...unless you like it!! Trent is a rough and tumble boy who is learning about manners and how to find the right level of energy vs. relaxation. It really helps if someone can play fetch for a while or take him for a long hike, so his house manners can be impeccable. He also enjoys games that work his brain like a Kong Wobbler, so he was to work for his food. He might be a little too hyper for small children until he gets older, but he could do well with older kids who can remind him of boundaries. Trent knows that life isn\u0027t all about play and has been working hard in his learning too. He knows all the basics like walking calmly on leash, sit, down, stay and coming when called (at least when the leash is still attached). Once Trent has had a full day of fun and energy burning, there is nothing he likes more than curling up with his human for belly rubs and snuggles. His whole body melts against you and he sinks to floor to fully enjoy his lovin\u0027. He was cat tested within the shelter environment, with a cat safely enclosed in a large space and Trent on leash. He showed interest in the cat but softened and obeyed obedience commands; he never barked or pulled toward the cat. Based on the assessment, he has shown the possibility of living successfully with a cat with a firm training plan in place to fully integrate the animals over a long period of time. Trent is an exuberant boy who will be a great fit into any home looking for a playful, friendly and intelligent pup. Come visit and see if he\u0027s perfect for your family."

    "description": "Marlowe is an affectionate Chihuahua mix who wants to be near you. He\u0027ll enjoy being carried by you and sleeping curled up against your legs, then snuggling with his human and doggie friends. This lovebug is well-behaved. He does well by himself in his crate, and he also walks well on a leash. He loves riding in cars, especially if he\u0027s on his way to a walk around the shops. Marlowe is looking for an adopter who will take care of him in his twilight years. He does well with mild-mannered dogs and cats, and will probably do well with older, respectful kids. Come meet this sweet gentleman today!"

    "description": "Saying Timmy\u0027s past is an enigma may be an understatement, but we pretty much know where he wants his future to go: a home he can call his own. Timmy\u0027s tail is always wagging while he looks at his favorite volunteers, with so much hope and love. He has made strides in the trust department since he first came in to APA, and little by little he is allowing for his friends to lean in close to him and sneak in a pet or two. He is just an ol\u0027 fashioned gentleman that takes his time before heavy petting sessions and doggie kisses. We are certain he is holding back a total love bug! The way to Timmy\u0027s heart has been strolls in nature; he loves walks around the shelter\u0027s fields, stop around to smell the roses (or Texas weeds!) and enjoy the company of his walking buddies. He has been learning leash manners and politely ignores other pups he encounters while in his adventures. Timmy lived in a home before, so he\u0027s probably got the house routine down. He keeps his shelter quarters in a tidy condition, and we think this will transfer to his future family home.

    "description": "Spanky is among the TOP ranks of APA\u0027s most disciplined, hard-working dogs! After months of work with his trainer, he mastered all the skills in his individualized training plan and is now a certified TOP (Total Obedience Program) Dog. In addition to his impressive repertoire of skills Spanky is a TOP dog in so many ways. We\u0027ll break it down for you like this: He\u0027s a TOP kisser. A hit with the ladies, Spanky is never one to shy away from PDA. He loves nothing more than to love up on his human friends and kiss and cuddle all day long. Essentially, he\u0027s a real-life teddy bear that will curl up with you in bed, offering the quiet comfort that only dogs can provide. He\u0027s a TOP dresser. Everyone at the shelter knows of Spanky\u0027s trademark look. He is rarely seen without a colorful neck tie. Always ready for a costume party, he even puts up with the most ridiculous pink, frilly ensembles. An entertainer at heart, Spanky loves to make people smile and laugh. He\u0027s a TOP decorator. Spanky is known as APA\u0027s resident interior designer. During his downtime, he keeps himself busy by redecorating his kennel with his bed and blankets. This little designer is so impressive, he even had a cameo on HGTV\u0027s House Hunters! Read all about it on our blog: https://www.austinpetsalive.org/2016/08/dont-miss-spankys-hgtv-debut-tune-into-house-hunters-on-aug-10/ He\u0027s a TOP entertainer. You never know what to expect when you peek inside his studio! It\u0027s always amusing when he\u0027s found wiggling under his blankets or crouched like a secret agent under his bed. Being the Southern gentleman that he is, Spanky always greets his guests with a toy in his mouth and a look in his soulful eyes that say, \"Want to play? Here\u0027s my favorite toy! He\u0027s a TOP leash walker. If you\u0027re looking for a dog that won\u0027t give you an arm workout, Spanky\u0027s your boy! He\u0027s easy breezy on his walks and prefers to cruise along at a slow and steady pace while taking intermittent sniffing breaks. He really just loves stopping at the bleachers for a long cuddle session. He\u0027s a TOP best friend. Being the theatrical extrovert that he is, Spanky just loves being around the people he loves and trusts. He can be a little shy at first, but once you win his trust, he will be your bestest friend for life and will make you feel like a rock star every day. He truly is a special, quirky, unique little boy with a larger-than-life personality! So what do you say? Could you be the TOP human in Spanky\u0027s life? He\u0027s looking for a pet-free, child-free home with minimal foot traffic. He likes quiet, peaceful environments and has no interest in dog parks, patio restaurants and other dog social scenes. More about the TOP Dog Program: The program is modelled after the AKC\u0027s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Spanky has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help him/her learn a number of skills including \"sit and \"down, walking nicely on leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers or other dogs, staying in a sit or down until told \"free,\" and coming when called. Now that Spanky successfully completed all the skills on his training plan, he is considered TOP Dog Ready! Check out a video on APA\u0027s CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https://vimeo.com/89434193"

Both boys love meeting people, their little tails wag so fast and they give puppy nuzzles and kisses. Dyson and Hoover must be adopted together.

Both boys love meeting people, their little tails wag so fast and they give puppy nuzzles and kisses. Dyson and Hoover must be adopted together. They will fuss and complain if one pup is picked up and the other one is not. But not to worry, they are so adorable people will be fighting over who gets to hold them! If they are placed on opposite sides in their space, Hoover will complain and roll/flip/move to get close to Dyson. They can get really rowdy and vocal when they play together which is just the cutest thing to see. Can you open your home and your heart for this special pair of pups?"

    "description": "Tito is a very friendly little guy who gets along famously with his nine foster siblings. Nothing slows him down, he has as much energy as dogs half his age, if not more! He eats in his crate to keep him from getting extra grub from his paw-mates\u0027 food bowls. He also believes any and all treats were meant for his royal self, but he is getting better with his manners. His favorite thing - other than food - is his curling up in his bed and blanket, and he is OK with sharing it with his foster brother. Tito enjoys the comfort of sleeping in the same room as the humans. He seems to be new to playtime, but he has discovered a fun little game of chase with one of his foster siblings who will engage others to play with him. Tito has congestive heart failure, so he will require medication twice a day with meals along with frequent potty breaks. It\u0027s hard to believe he has any medical issues with his outgoing and lively personality. A home with access to a yard and another playful pup is all Tito needs to thrive. But don\u0027t take our word for it, go visit Tito in his foster home and fall in love with him today!"

For example, he\u0027s learning that when he touches his person\u0027s hand with his nose and gives eye contact, it gets him a treat! He does love those treats, so they\u0027re also helping him become a fast learner. He knows to stay right next to his person when on leash walks. Minding the \"sit command is next in his learning curve. Benny is a silly boy who likes those romps in the yard - and then he\u0027s a big fan of naps. Come take a romp with him and see if he\u0027s right for your home."

I should also mention that he loves playing fetch, and he\u0027s great about bringing the ball back to you and dropping it. If he thinks you don\u0027t see the ball on the ground, he\u0027ll politely pick it up and set it in your lap, so Rio manages to enjoy fetch with even the laziest of tennis ball throwers. True to his name, Rio also really LOVES being in the water! Whether you\u0027re hosing him off or letting him take a dip in a pool or creek, he\u0027ll take all the water he can find please. Rio may be a big guy, but he is very easy to walk on leash. He loves walking outside to gently take in all the sights and smells around him...always walking by your side at a nice pace. He\u0027s a smart guy who sits politely for treats and appears housebroken. Rio is just a quiet, content soul who enjoys being with his person. He\u0027s an easy friend who would love it if you threw him a tennis ball or took him to swim, but he\u0027d also like a nice quiet walk around the neighborhood. Come meet this handsome guy today!"

She really is the best of both worlds--a couch potato in the house and an intrepid explorer on the trail! Whether you\u0027re in the mood for curling up with a good book on a lazy Sunday afternoon or taking a stroll around the park, Jazzy will happily stay by your side. This middle-aged dog is young at heart, and is currently impressing her hosts in an APA foster home. We think she would be a great match for a moderately active home where she can continue to receive some exercise and a lot of love. Around the house, Jazzy is an affectionate cuddler. She gets in plenty of lazing around, preferably near (or on top of) her favorite people. She is a good walking partner, and might even be up an occasional jog. While she was at the shelter, she became a RuffTail Runner favorite, meaning she gets out on the busy trail on a regular basis for some outdoorsy adventures. She was also a popular girl in playgroup, playing nicely with her fellow shelter dogs in a big play yard. She also likes to wrestle with rope and squeaky toys Give this lady a chance to learn the rules of the house, and she\u0027ll make a happy addition to your family. Of all her great qualities, you\u0027ll love the way she lights up when she sees you. She has a special way of luring you in with a look that says,\"Want to go have some fun?\" Consider meeting Jazzy today so you can see how much she has to offer!"

    "description": "We don\u0027t know much about Lady Red\u0027s past, but we are certain that her future is sunny, with a 100% chance of a forever family. Lady Red currently resides in a very special and loving foster home, where she has proven over and over how perfect she is. As a low maintenance gal, who is house and crate trained and who loves nothing more than to meet and greet new people with her striking beauty and soft manners, she\u0027d be a good addition to most families. Just like us humans, our beautiful Lady comes with some quirks. She is partially blind, possibly due to having Canine Diabetes. This is a chronic disease that is very easily managed by having her on a controlled glucose (sugar) dog food, as well as insulin shots. Lady Red knows this quick shot is part of her daily health routine so administering her medication is very simple. This beauty is so intuitive, that it took her close to nothing to memorize her foster home and breeze through it with no problems, regardless of her visual impairment. On a recent interview, Lady Red confessed that her favorite activities are car rides and napping under the sun, as they make her feel warm and fuzzy feelings. She absolutely loves the feeling of soft wind and the shiny sun on her sweet face, and she can often be seen around town walking and exploring with her foster family. She has good leash manners and is learning basic commands. Lady Red has come a long way to find her place in this world. If you\u0027d like to walk this earth right next to her, don\u0027t delay! She\u0027ll be waiting patiently."

    "description": "To Dax, every day would be Independence Day - if he just didn\u0027t need those humans to toss his tennis balls. This tiny, spunky boy is happy to entertain himself. But he will check in with his humans for attention, especially when it involves those tennis balls. And treats! He loves small, squeaky tennis balls and will prance to pick one up, then toss it into the air himself to catch again. He\u0027s also fond of other small squeaky toys. Once Dax is done with playtime, he\u0027s content to just hang out and once again display his independence. Like a little king, he\u0027s pleased to interact with you, but you need his permission first. Then he\u0027ll give kisses and accept a cuddle. This feisty boy walks well on a leash and he promises to be a delightful companion"

It\u0027s a very rewarding feeling to win his love! He really is the epitome of the ultimate loyal best friend.

Zydeco would make a perfect jogging buddy! He\u0027d also love to join a family that would include him on their outings and adventures.

    "description": "We\u0027ve rustled up a good\u0027un here! Rustler is a handsome, healthy young adult who would love to settle in with a family. This fun dog will put a smile on everyone\u0027s face. Rustler has previously lived in a home, so he knows his way around the house. He\u0027s good with basic commands and is anxious to learn more. He\u0027s fantastic on a leash - he loves to go for walks, and he doesn\u0027t get distracted by other people or dogs, as he keeps his focus on his walking partner. Rustler has a medium energy level, and once he\u0027s back at home he takes life a little slower. He\u0027s very affectionate, and loves to be with his favorite people. He\u0027s got an ever-present bounce in his step that reflects his sunny outlook, and wants to be everyone\u0027s friend. Because he\u0027s previously lived with a family, Rustler is not particularly enamored with shelter life, and he\u0027d love a chance to make a great impression on you! Don\u0027t forget that when you adopt from APA!, you\u0027re helping two dogs - the one you\u0027re welcoming into your home, and the one who will be able to join our program."

    "description": "Sweet Sandy loves people and gets so excited when it\u0027s time to go for a walk outside her kennel. She loves snuggling, getting to play in the yard, or taking a leisurely walk around the neighborhood. Her energy level is perfect and matches her surroundings. If it\u0027s time to run, she\u0027s a great running buddy, but if it\u0027s time to stop and smell the roses, she\u0027s good with that too. If you act like it\u0027s time to play a game of chase, she\u0027ll zoomie around the room with you until it\u0027s time to relax on the couch. Sandy also LOVES to swim or splash around in the water, so if you enjoy the water - or enjoy watching a dog splash around with glee, then you need to meet Sandy. She has experience in a home, is housebroken, and has lived peacefully with cats! This beauty also has brains - she knows the sit, down, and shake commands. Come meet the beautiful and spunky Sandy today!"

She and her sister came to APA pretty confused and timid, but it didn\u0027t take this little love bug long to open up and show the world just how friendly she is! Highly affectionate is an understatement with this sweet girl. She loves cuddling with her people, and getting pets. She\u0027s adorably happy and wiggly with joy, and is incredibly generous with her kisses. The APA volunteers rave about her vivacious happy tail wag that she\u0027ll get when she sees a friend approaching. It\u0027s absolutely precious! Ellie is very sweet-natured, and enjoys her canine play groups, and also likes kids. She knows to sit for treats, and is awesome on her easy walk harness. She is a big fan of going for walks and jogs, but is equally as thrilled to lounge with her people around the house. Ellie enjoys learning new things and is in the Total Obedience Program. The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modeled after the AKC\u0027s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test.

She would do wonderfully in a home with tons of love to shower her with. She\u0027s exploding with affection and wants nothing more than to show her family how much she loves and appreciates them.

    "description": "Olivia is an affectionate American Pit Bull Terrier mix who likes to zoom around play yards and is often eager to go for a run. She enjoys playing fetch with treats and tennis balls. After bursts of energy, she\u0027s ready to settle down. This cutie has a calm side, too. She\u0027ll lick your face and gently take treats from you. She\u0027ll lean against you for rubs and loves butt scratches. She\u0027s eager to learn; she already knows Sit, Down and Stay. Olivia is seeking a quiet home with a big yard for her to run and play. She does well with kids and dogs who like to play roughly. Olivia enjoys learning new things and is in the Total Obedience Program. The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modeled after the AKC\u0027s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Olivia as a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help her learn the skills to become the best dog she can be! She is learning skills like sit and down, walking nicely on leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers or other dogs, staying in a sit or down until told \"free,\" as well as \u0027place\u0027 (running-to and staying-in a designated spot) and coming when called. Once Olivia successfully completes all the skills on her training plan she will be considered TOP Dog Ready! Olivia is working hard to become a wonderful pet and as a part of APA\u0027s Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with Olivia after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA\u0027s CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https://vimeo.com/89434193 Come meet this sweetheart today!"

He\u0027s good in a crate and can entertain himself, especially if he has a chewy to occupy him Traveler can happily live with respectful dogs. He\u0027ll give kisses to and run around with well-matched dogs. He seems neutral with cats: he\u0027s curious about them, but doesn\u0027t want to bother them, so that match may be a possibility. Traveler is seeking an adopter with time for all his loving; is it yours?"

This athletic lady likes to run and explore, then come back for petting and treats. While at play and at rest, Stella likes to stay close to her human friends for attention and reassurance, and she bonds quickly. Out of the house, she can be nervous around strangers, but she does well on a leash and is well behaved on trails. Stella is crate and house trained, sleeping all night in the crate. She is calm and quiet in the crate, and if the door is left open, she will enter it voluntarily to lay down, relax and play with her toys. She makes herself at home very quickly and seems confident and relaxed. She is an expert cuddler and is happy to \"Netflix and chill, snuggled up to her person for hours-as long as she gets a run in! This loyal, lovely lady will make a wonderful addition to an active home with an adopters who can give her the training and opportunity to really shine. Stella has so much love to share, and she can\u0027t wait to show you just how much!"

Amma has previously lived with a family and knows her way around the house. She\u0027s a real people pleaser - she loves to learn, and thinks training is great fun. She knows quite a few commands already, and would love to continue training with her new family. We love Amma\u0027s affectionate, silly personality. She\u0027s very cuddly and loves to spend time with her favorite people. Amma has a medium energy level - she loves to burn off a few calories playing fetch or chase, but she enjoys down time as well. She would prefer a home with all adults or older kids. Don\u0027t forget that when you adopt from APA!, you\u0027re helping two dogs - the one you\u0027re welcoming into your home, and the one who will be able to join our program."

    "description": "We\u0027re not going to leave out the best part - we\u0027re here to mention the bisque! Bisque is a low-key, but fun young adult. Bisque has lost his sight, but isn\u0027t let blindness get in the way of enjoying life. He is a goofy, playful dog who loves being around people. He\u0027s been spending time in an APA! foster home, and has shown us that he will make a fun companion. Losing his eyesight must have sharpened Bisque\u0027s hearing. He loves to hear praise and his favorite people\u0027s voices, and he\u0027ll respond quickly. He\u0027s not a super-affectionate dog, but he does enjoy some occasional petting and head-scratching. Bisque will need a patient family who can help him get used to his new environment. It will take him a bit of time to adjust to his new surroundings and learn his way around. But once he does, he\u0027s got a low-stress, casual attitude towards life that lets him enjoy his daily routine. Bisque has a lower energy level, so he doesn\u0027t need a great deal of stimulation during the day. He enjoys some outside time so that he can sniff around and explore, but he doesn\u0027t need heavy-duty exercise. Bisque would probably best enjoy a quieter, low-energy home. Concerned about his blindness? Once he gets used to your home\u0027s layout his needs won\u0027t be much different than any other dog. Bisque would love to meet you and share his carefree approach to life! And remember that when you adopt, you\u0027ll also be helping another dog who can his place in our program."

    "description": "Frodo is a party animal. He loves to have a good time, all the time. He\u0027s also super smart and very sweet, so if you consider yourself more of an extrovert, you may have found an excellent wingman in Frodo. Frodo will play with you all day if you let him. He especially loves to play with lacrosse balls, and enjoys showing up the high school team by making an occasional interception. He also loves being loved on, and gives lots of love in return. The most adorable thing about him is his one eyebrow. He is a very expressive dog anyways. You won\u0027t ever struggle to know how Frodo is feeling, but his eyebrow puts him over the top. Frodo is house trained, walks pretty well on a leash, and is well-mannered when left alone in the house. He is very treat motivated, and will do just about anything for a snack. In fact, Frodo is in APA\u0027s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) program and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week toward the goal of passing the American Kennel Club\u0027s CGC test! Frodo has been working hard to be a dog you can take anywhere with pride. To pass the CGC test, a dog must demonstrate obedience and general reliability in real world situations. Dogs in APA\u0027s CGC program learn to sit and down, walk nicely on leash, sit calmly when approached by strangers or another dog, won\u0027t approach people or dogs without permission, greet people appropriately, stay in a sit or down until told and come when called. As part of APA\u0027s CGC program you can work with APA to continue to build a training relationship with Frodo after adoption and get officially CGC certified for free! Check out a video about CGC: https://vimeo.com/89434193"

    "description": "Booth is a loving, goofy boy who would be the ideal companion for someone with a moderately active lifestyle. He loves to play and enjoys swimming and playing fetch, carrying around his stuffed animal wherever he goes. He is housebroken and crate-trained, and has received obedience training and knows several commands, including sit, stay, down, speak, and shake. While he is very athletic and loves to play, he also enjoys being a couch potato, requiring only a few head scratches as he watches a movie with you. Booth would do best in a low traffic home with a yard. Once he knows and trusts you, he will love you forever. Can you give this sweet boy a home where he can thrive?"

    "description": "Tank Girl might look like a bruiser, but she\u0027s really just a goof ball at heart. All she wants to do is give you lots of love and affection. If you are a big cuddler who likes walks and has a few rawhide bones to spare, Tank Girl will love you forever. Tank Girl learns something new everyday! With the exception of spotting a squirrel, Tank Girl walks well on leash and knows sit and down. Tank Girl is overwhelmed with love with her person and has a hard time being alone. She really does not like being in a crate, but she will sleep soundly through the night at the foot of your bed if you let her. She is pretty hilarious when she sleeps. She prefers to nap with all four legs sticking straight in the air. Which may explain why she hates the crate; it\u0027s just cramping her style. She prefers curling up on her own blanket to relax. Tank Girl has never met a friend she didn\u0027t like! On a recent sleepover, she greeted everyone politely and quickly requested belly rubs. She might give a gentle nose if she isn\u0027t done with being petted, but she isn\u0027t at all insistent. Do you have a dog friendly work place? Because Tank Girl knows how put in data, gossip at the water cooler and tell you when it\u0027s lunch time. And she won\u0027t have to be at home alone! We are also happy to assist with obedience training at APA! She\u0027s naturally very respectful in the home. No jumping where she shouldn\u0027t be or chewing what isn\u0027t hers. She really loves walks, so a family that can do that with her once a day would be ideal. And she would prefer a house with lots of laps to lay in. She is a dog of many cuddles. If you are looking for some big love from a big girl, Tank Girl would suit you well."

    "description": "We couldn\u0027t think of a more fitting name for Twister because once you meet him, you\u0027ll get caught up in a whirlwind of love! This sweet boy will happily sit quietly by your side and lend a listening ear. It\u0027s hard not to fall in love when you look into those soulful brown eyes that say, \"Come sit down with me and tell me all about your day.\" Want to play? Well, Twister is also a puppy at heart! His joy is contagious when he\u0027s chasing after balls or playing tug with his rope toy. Always up for fun and games, he will sweep you up into a spin of laughs for hours on end. Just as good as with play, Twister likes to work his brain. Like a cat, he\u0027s curious of his surroundings and loves to be in the middle of things. Pop the trunk and he\u0027ll jump right in with a look on his face that says, \"That\u0027s what you wanted me to do, right?\" He loves getting outside and inspecting every bush - and if there\u0027s a water source nearby, he\u0027ll dive right in! Twister enjoys learning new things and is in the Total Obedience Program. The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modeled after the AKC\u0027s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Twister as a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help him learn the skills to become the best dog she can be! Currently, he knows the commands \u0027sit\u0027, \u0027down\u0027, \u0027shake\u0027, \u0027come\u0027 and \u0027stay\u0027. Did I hear you say wow!? He is learning skills walking nicely on leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers or other dogs, staying in a sit or down until told \"free,\" as well as \u0027place\u0027 (running-to and staying-in a designated spot) and coming when called. Once Twister successfully completes all the skills on her training plan he will be considered TOP Dog Ready! Twister is working hard to become a wonderful pet and as a part of APA\u0027s Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with Twister after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA\u0027s CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https://vimeo.com/89434193 Twister invites you to come on down and fall for him at first sight!"

She\u0027s also a play group rock star who loves to play with other dogs. Olive is sweet and quiet in her kennel, even when the dogs around her are barking their heads off. Her kennel is always clean too, so she appears to be house trained and she quietly and patiently waits her turn to be walked. Once she gets to know you, she\u0027s a happy and loving girl without being pushy about it. Olive would love to have a person or family to play ball with her and show her what real love is. Being a black dog in a shelter means she gets overlooked in favor of the cute fluffy dogs; will you be the person who sees her for the hidden gem she really is?"

    "description": "Who\u0027s the Boss(Man)? We\u0027re glad you asked because this 4-year- old, handsome fellow is ready for a home complete with loving humans to call his own. He plays fetch like a Boss(Man) and can chillax like no one\u0027s business. He has a great set of basic obedience skills -- knows sit and down, waits nicely at doors, won\u0027t pester you while you eat, and of course he\u0027s house-trained. Do you need a companion while you work? This Boss is your Man. His foster mom takes him to her office each day where he relaxes on his dog bed and doesn\u0027t seem to mind being doted on by the office staff. (It\u0027s a \"ruff life but somedog\u0027s gotta do it.) When he\u0027s not by your side, you can probably find him snuggled under a blanket. His foster mom says he loves being tucked in tight. Boss Man loves humans and quickly builds a loyal bond. He\u0027d love to have a quiet backyard where he can play with his human friends. Boss Man has had a few rough years resulting in some mild arthritis in his legs. While he loves a good game of fetch, he has some days where he just needs to lay low. We\u0027ll let you in on a little secret, Boss Man would really rather NOT be the Boss. He\u0027ll happily leave that job to you. (NOTE: Boss Man must be adopted out to a home with a backyard.)"

    "description": "Charlotte is a sweet sensitive soul who deserves so much love. Won\u0027t you come meet her and help her to be the wonderful companion she is meant to be? She has settled into the kennel routine and will make great eye contact with you, but she really wants to be in her forever home. Charlotte is a little reserved these days. She doesn\u0027t quite understand what she\u0027s doing in the shelter. But once you take her out of her kennel she loves to run and would make a great running buddy for a human running partner. She is sweet, very calm and also athletic. This sweet girl has been disappointed it seems, so she is initially a little bit shy with her emotions, but once she is comfy with you, she will gently lean in and let you know she is ready for some pets and some love. How long could it possibly take before she fully trusts and gives and receives love? Probably not long. Just don\u0027t let her cool calm attitude put you off, there is definitely a love filled girl who wants to be by your side and be your forever friend. This dear one would be most happy in a home where she will be with an active human or family who will make her a full member of the pack and include her in all possible daily activities. If that sounds like a great match with you, please come to APA! and ask for Charlotte."

    "description": "From Duke\u0027s temporary foster during Hurricane Harvey: \"He has been so wonderful. He has such a sweet heart and is so gentle. He is the biggest cuddler and really loves hugs \u0026 kisses. I live alone, and we did not have much interaction with other kids or cats. However with the few dogs that we did run into, he was patient and let them sniff him. Duke is house \u0026 crate trained. He whines to let you know he needs to go out. He can keep himself entertained with toys. He has medium to high energy level. I really hope he finds a great home because he is the sweetest dog.\" Duke, or Dukelberry as he\u0027s known by his friends, is one of those dogs who exudes coolness. He\u0027s a happy guy who is content to go with the flow; this translates to being really easy to walk on leash and well behaved if you\u0027re out on a patio or walking a trail. Duke has already lived in a home, so we know he\u0027s housebroken and crate trained. He knows the \u0027sit\u0027 and \u0027down\u0027 commands and seems to pick up on skills quickly. He loves treats, so he would make a great training candidate if you\u0027re looking to teach him new things. Duke has a great energy level - he enjoys playing and having fun, but he\u0027s relaxed and chill when it\u0027s not playtime. He will lean in gently and sneak you kisses as a thank you for being his friend too. Do you want a relaxed, fun, easy-to-walk, housebroken dog? Come meet the Duke of APA today!"

She will settle down in her own space, but prefers being near you. Gisele is very alert and excitable. She will bark to let you know any time a person or animal (including squirrels) approaches your yard or door. She is successful with basic commands and is quick to recognize/respect routines. She is excellent with her crate and goes in easily with a small treat prompt. Gisele is an enthusiastic member of the family. She is smart, wants to please and has endless amount of energy and love to share. Within moments, Gisele will steal your heart with her beautiful face, curious looks, spirited personality and loving manner (after she greets you with a series of loud barks). If you have the time, energy and heart to commit to this sweet, playful dog then get ready for a truly fabulous new member of your family!"

    "description": "Elvis will play his way into your heart. He loves squeaky toys, balls, and his favorite is tug of war! One may think that a senior dog would not be as energetic and eager to play, but Elvis has broken the mold. He is active and loves the outdoors, so Elvis enjoys taking walks with his owner and exploring. He loves to be with his people, yet Elvis can be independent. He is content playing with his toys alone and can be left by himself at home, but when his humans come home, Elvis is the perfect companion. This dog will follow you from room to room because he loves his humans and simply wants to be near them. As trust builds up, Elvis\u0027s sweet personality shines through and his loyal self is all yours! He is the perfect combination of loving, curious, smart, and playful. Elvis is the perfect dog for someone who wants a companion and enjoys having the best of both worlds: a mature dog, with the heart of a young pup."

    "description": "You won\u0027t get too much bucking from this Bronco! Bronco is a sweet young adult who should make a great long-term companion for a lucky family. Bronco has spent time living in a home before, so he knows his way around the house and should be able to make a quick transition to his new home. He walks well on a leash, knows his basic commands, and has shown no sign of being destructive when he spends some time alone in the house. He can be a bit shy when first meeting new people, but give Bronco a chance to warm up and his silly, affectionate personality will soon show itself. He loves nothing better than a good belly rub. He\u0027s also an expert at chasing a tennis ball. Returning the ball? Well he could use some work on that. But he\u0027ll have great fun trying to play keep away from his family! Bronco has lived with dogs and kids in the past, and wouldn\u0027t mind sharing a home with them again. But he seems to be a versatile dog who could succeed in a variety of home environments. Hopefully it will be yours! And don\u0027t forget that when you adopt from APA!, you\u0027re helping two dogs - the one you\u0027re welcoming into your home, and the one who will be able to join our program."

This boy doesn\u0027t let anything get him down, and if you\u0027re ever feeling down, he will definitely lift your spirits just by being around him. Spike loves when you\u0027re sitting in a chair, so he can back up into you for petting and scratching optimization. His fur is so soft that you won\u0027t mind. If you choose the floor, he\u0027ll wiggle all the way up to you to get closer. The best of all, though, is if you throw him a tennis ball or toy...you can just see his eyes light up with excitement. Spike has also never met a squeaky toy he didn\u0027t like. Spike is a smart guy who appears housebroken and already knows sit and down. He loves treats, so we think he would be a great student for anything else you want to teach him. I think most of all, though, he\u0027s just so fun to be around! He is guaranteed to make you smile and laugh with his goofy antics. Come meet Spike at APA today and let his contagious joie de vivre make your day brighter!"

    "description": "Davey is a bouncy boy who gives off great vibes that say he wants to play with his new human friends - especially if they\u0027ll throw those balls he wants to fetch! And if the tennis ball is replaced with a treat, he\u0027s even happier. This handsome, healthy dude has such a bright, sweet disposition and he\u0027s so much fun to be around that he\u0027s ready to liven up anyone\u0027s adventures. And he appears to be crate and house trained, so he\u0027ll be a wonderful couch companion, too. Davey enjoys learning new things. He is in APA\u0027s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) program and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week toward the goal of passing the American Kennel Club\u0027s CGC test! Davey has been working hard to be a dog you can take anywhere with pride. To pass the CGC test, a dog must demonstrate obedience and general reliability in real world situations. Dogs in APA\u0027s CGC program learn to sit and down, walk nicely on leash, sit calmly when approached by strangers or another dog, won\u0027t approach people or dogs without permission, greet people appropriately, stay in a sit or down until told \"free,\" and come when called. As part of APA\u0027s CGC program you can work with APA to continue to build a training relationship with Davey after adoption and get officially CGC certified for free! Check out a video about CGC: https://vimeo.com/89434193 Come meet this boy and see if he\u0027s perfect for your home."

    "description": "Bevo is a super-friendly dog who is looking for a family that is ready to love him back! This young adult is in the prime of life, and he\u0027s looking to become a long-term companion for a lucky home. Did we mention he\u0027s friendly? He bonds quickly with new humans and becomes a very devoted friend. He loves getting a good petting session. Wagging his tail just isn\u0027t enough - he likes to wiggle his whole body! But he\u0027s not just a loverboy. He also enjoys getting in some exercise. He has a medium energy level, loves going on walks and makes a great walking partner. He\u0027s also very treat motivated. He\u0027s also great in the home and completely housebroken. Bevo enjoys learning new things and is in the Total Obedience Program. The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modeled after the AKC\u0027s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Bevo as a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help him learn the skills to become the best dog she can be! He is learning skills like sit and down, walking nicely on leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers or other dogs, staying in a sit or down until told \"free,\" as well as \u0027place\u0027 (running-to and staying-in a designated spot) and coming when called. Once Bevo successfully completes all the skills on her training plan he will be considered TOP Dog Ready! Bevo is working hard to become a wonderful pet and as a part of APA\u0027s Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with Bevo after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA\u0027s CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https://vimeo.com/89434193 Follow Bevo\u0027s adventures on Instagram @attaboy.bevo"

    "description": "Here are some things that are awesome about Dennis. He is house trained, knows sit, and \"bring it here\" when playing fetch. He is also hilarious; he makes all kinds of funny noises and gestures, and looks like some kind of goofy bunny-velociraptor hybrid when he is chasing balls, which is often. He is good at entertaining himself. He is very loving and loyal. When he considers you his person, you will be everything to him; he loves to be near you and to get belly rubs. While Dennis would love to have space to stretch his legs in a yard, he also wouldn\u0027t mind living a homebody life in an apartment. He\u0027s got a decent amount of energy for a mature, 8 year old gentleman. Dennis is looking for a best friend that shows him the world and helps him see the good in humans. In return, this handsome devil will give you all the love you can handle."

You can see the excitement in her eyes when she knows you\u0027re about to have a good romp or game of tug-of-war. She\u0027s a clever one who enjoys learning new skills; in her short time with us, she\u0027s already mastered running on the treadmill and \u0027sit\u0027, Like the star she is, after a job well done, she will look to you for applause on a job well done. Beyond the fun and games, YOU might just become Lola\u0027s favorite thing. She is super affectionate towards the special people in her life; she loves giving kisses to those closest to her, and you\u0027ll no doubt witness her pure joy when her adorable smooshy face greets you. P.S. That smooshy face also means she sometimes snorts while running zoomies in the backyard; it\u0027s adorable, trust us. Lola may be able to do the cha-cha with a doggie sibling at her forever home. We\u0027d be happy to facilitate a meet and greet to see how they get along! Would you like to make your home Lola\u0027s own Copacabana?"

Take him out for a visit and you\u0027ll see that Tugg is the whole package-highly skilled, a good boy in the home, and super athletic! Here at the shelter, Tugg has become quite popular with the volunteers. His friends often remark on how well-mannered he is on the leash. In fact, he has become the go-to dog for behavioral training sessions. Always eager to please, he is happy to show off his many skills. His sleepover friend reported that he\u0027s the perfect gentleman in the home. He waits to be invited on the bed and will only chew and tug on his toys. He also shows great potential in being crate trained. Tugg has so many great qualities, but anyone who knows him will tell you that he is the shelter\u0027s most talented fetch player! It\u0027s hard not to laugh when he breaks out into full-body wiggles at the sight of a tennis ball. His happiness is contagious when he\u0027s playing his favorite sport. And when playtime is over, he\u0027s ready for a long snuggle session on the couch. If that\u0027s not reason enough to take him home, look at that sweet baby seal face! He has a way of tugging people toward him with those soulful eyes. Don\u0027t resist the tug and visit with him today!"

    "description": "Meet Faraon; this honorable gentleman is loyal, loving, curious, and very attentive! Much like a Boy Scout, our Faraon enjoys being apart of a family-pack while going on adventures. Exploring with him is easy; he\u0027s great on a leash, responds when called, and enjoys carrying supplies for the team (e.g water, snacks, etc.). His intelligence, eagerness to please, and sweet-tooth have made him easy to train. Not only does Faraon know basic commands such as \"Sit, \"Down, \"Stay, \"Relax; but also \"Home, \"Heel, \"Spin, and \"Touch\"! This boy\u0027s insatiable appetite for learning makes training easy \u0026 enjoyable for everyone involved. After a day of moderate physical and/or mental exercise, Faraon likes to relax within the home - often you will find him on the carpet or in his crate, but never on furniture. His respect for household objects would make anyone proud - this dog hasn\u0027t shown any destructive tendencies and is fully house-broken. Faraon is a model pup that would love nothing more than to be your one and only. Would you give him a chance?"

His smirky smile will melt your heart, watch out Princess Leia the line is long for this guy! This guy is so cool to hang out with and a Millennium Falcon is not required! This gentle giant has has a few years on him and his back legs are a little wobbly, but after years of dealing with Storm Troopers its to be expected. He has enjoyed some water therapy in Lady Bird Lake and would really appreciate the opportunity to continue adventures either at the lake or possibly a pool with supervision. He can be easily entertained by most fluffy objects and probably would enjoy a new light saber as what would he be without one? Hans Solo will be a loyal friend by your side and may the force be with you! Inquire about him as he\u0027s out of this world!"

May is quite the athlete and loves fetching and water - and especially loves when these two are combined. She\u0027s been known to stick her whole head underwater to retrieve a ball. As much fun as she is to play with, she is also very well-behaved in a home. She is housebroken, calm, and respectful of human items and food. She is content to snuggle with you or lay by your feet as you watch TV. May knows \u0027sit\u0027 and walks well on leash. She would make a great hiking partner. She also seems to learn quickly and loves food, so we think she would make a great training student. Aside from her skills, she\u0027s just a doll and a delight to be around. She has the biggest, brightest smile and is so much fun! Come visit her at APA today."

    "description": "Clark is a sweet and mellow gentleman. He loves his human friends and is eager to please. He has a cute way to communicate \"I love you with wiggles and sounds when his friends walk by. Clark plays it cool and isn\u0027t a needy guy at all. He\u0027s house trained and can just chill by himself, looking out the window or hanging out on the patio, or he can spend a whole day cuddling next to you on the couch. But don\u0027t let his quiet demeanor deceive you. Clark is also up for an adventure! He\u0027s on the Rufftail Running team and is happy for long walks or jogs - whatever his human is into! He is very easy to handle on a leash, knows his commands and stays in touch through eye contact. The ideal family for Clark will make sure to keep him somewhat active, but more importantly will make time to spend with him around the house. He loves to be in your lap on your couch, but is smart enough to realize that he needs to get your permission first. He loves people so much, and may be able to share a home with a well-matched doggie sibling. We call him McDreamy because he looks deep into your eyes and you want to tell him your secrets. Whether you live in an apartment or house, Clark will be your faithful sidekick at home or around town, from the moment you give him the opportunity of a forever home.

    "description": "Gracie is an Austinite through and through. She loves staying active in any way possible: walking the neighborhood, jogging by your bike, swimming in the lake, or hiking the trails. She\u0027s also a fetch master and tug enthusiast. Between her leash skills and love of people, she makes a great companion for food truck dining and coffee shop patios. After a run or a swim or a game of fetch, she\u0027s more than happy to snuggle up with you and shower you with kisses. This intelligent, affectionate pup is always eager to learn new tricks (especially if there are treats in it for her) and is in the Total Obedience Program. The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modelled after the AKC\u0027s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Gracie has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help her learn the skills to become the best dog she can be! She is learning skills like sit and down, walking nicely on leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers or other dogs, staying in a sit or down until told \"free,\" and coming when called. Once Gracie successfully completes all the skills on his/her training plan he/she will be considered TOP Dog Ready! Gracie is working hard to become a wonderful pet and as a part of APA\u0027s Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with Gracie after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA\u0027s CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https://vimeo.com/89434193"

    "description": "From Porter\u0027s Foster: \"I\u0027ve had Porter on several overnights and only heard him bark once, and by once I mean literally once. That said, if he hears something of interest his cute ears will perk up and he will run to see what\u0027s happening. He will follow his person around the house, but he\u0027s happy to be left alone also. If you want to cuddle, he would LOVE to cuddle. If you invite him on furniture, he would LOVE join you on the furniture. But he will also respect your space if you ask him to. He is calm \u0026 quiet almost all of the time. He\u0027s a wonderful companion in the home and out in the garden. He loves to lounge both inside and outside!\" Porter is a congenial gentleman who wants to make his human friends happy. If you want to cuddle, he would love to cuddle with you. If you invite him to join you on the couch, he would love to do that, too. But if you want some private time, he\u0027ll go entertain himself. Or take a snooze. This calm, quiet boy plays well with other dogs at APA! Then he hopes to go for walks with his humans, and does well on his leash. He\u0027s a smart boy who answers to the \u0027sit,\u0027 \u0027down,\u0027 \u0027stay\u0027 and \u0027shake\u0027 commands. On his sleepovers, he enjoys rolling in the backyard grass and doing some zoomies before putting his head in his person\u0027s lap for some extra petting. He\u0027s happy to lounge about inside and out. Porter is a loyal, affectionate boy who\u0027s looking for a calm home with a yard to explore and older kids to walk with. One with space to stretch out in for a nap would be ideal. If that sounds like your home, come meet this boy today!"

She\u0027ll move into a new home with little stress due to her great manners and mellow disposition. Dakota enjoys walks and does well on her leash though she is curious about the world. She is terrific in her crate and even knows some commands such as \u0027sit\u0027 and \u0027shake\u0027. She is an affectionate gal who will be generous in allowing you to satisfy your desire to give belly rubs all the live long day if you like! Come meet Dakota...she\u0027s waiting for you!!"

    "description": "Minka embodies everything that is good and pure about a dog. In a word, she is resilient. The wounds from her rough past are visible on her skin, but her effervescent spirit shines through when she flashes that gorgeous smile and breaks out into full-body wiggles. This sweet girl has never met a stranger. Everyone who walks by her kennel door is a potential new best friend. Stop and give her a pet and she\u0027ll reward you with kisses and cuddles. It\u0027s always amusing when she flops over for belly rubs and wiggles around with her stubby legs up in the air. She may be missing an ear, but that won\u0027t stop her from living life to its fullest. She loves getting out and sniffing new scents. She\u0027s great on the leash and is more than happy to join you on a leisurely stroll. Her favorite activity, however, is snuggling. Nothing makes her happier than canoodling with her human friends on the couch, snorting and snuffling in delight! Minka has so much potential to make her forever family very happy for many years to come. So what do you say? Are you ready to give Minka the loving home she so deserves? Please consider meeting her today!"

    "description": "Julio is a puppy in an adult dog\u0027s body, in the best of the ways. He looks and acts like that goofy, lanky teenager we all know and love. Julio is always up for a party, and he lives life to the fullest, whether that\u0027s romping around the yard, chasing a toy, or tricking you into giving him all your treats. Julio is all about those treats! He knows sit, down, shake (he\u0027s ambidextrous!), stay, and come. He will do anything for food, so there\u0027s probably no end to what you could teach him! Julio is also already housebroken. He would probably enjoy an active home where playing and fun are the name of the game. Julio is just one of the happiest dogs you\u0027ll meet; he has this big, goofy grin that seems to say, \"Hey guys! What are we doing next?! His zest for life is absolutely contagious. And have you seen the guy? He is so handsome! However, he doesn\u0027t let his looks get to his head, and will greet you with his tongue hanging out of that big, adorable, goofy grin. Come meet our favorite good lookin, goofball today."

    "description": "Thor is your guy if you enjoy the one to one of having an \"only\" dog. He is a dog whose supreme wish is a home of his own without other doggie siblings. He hasn\u0027t been observed with cats or children. Thor is said to be eager and silly. He\u0027s eager to learn, that\u0027s for sure. He\u0027s a dream on a leash and loves jaunting around the ball fields. If you want a goofy snuggler, Thor is going to fill that bill. When you meet him at the shelter he will seem on high alert, but once away from the shelter environment, snuggler deluxe and best friend are his MO. And he loves his treats, so is quite motivated for lessons and to learn. Thor seems to listen totally, with his ears showing he is paying attention. They will move to the top of his head when he\u0027s listening, and the tiniest flop over of the ears lets you know he\u0027s paying full attention. Isn\u0027t that cute? Thor would love to be your only four-legged friend, so please come meet him and give him the home in which he will thrive for all time. And remember, all APA adoptions come with free behavior assistance through APA\u0027s behavior team. In addition to all of Thor\u0027s wonderful natural qualities, he has been working hard to be a dog you can take anywhere with pride. Thor has been working on his Canine Good Citizen skills with APA staff and volunteers. To pass the American Kennel Club\u0027s CGC test (and be considered CGC-ready by APA), a dog must demonstrate obedience and general reliability in real world situations. An APA CGC-ready dog knows sit and down, walks nicely on leash, will sit calmly when you are approached by strangers or another dog, won\u0027t approach people or dogs without permission, stays in sit or down until told \"free,\" and comes when called. This training is very connected to your dog\u0027s relationship with you, so regardless of where Thor is in this training program at the time of adoption, APA will work with you to help you establish this relationship and keep the training going. Check out a video about CGC: http://player.vimeo.com/video/89434193"

    "description": "Hello! Do you want cute, spritely and smart as a whip when you adopt a dog? Then you came to the right place! Farrah is a bundle of fun, rolled up in a treat-motivated body that is always ready for the next adventure. This young boxer mix weighs all of 40 pounds, so she\u0027s a perfect size for just about any household. Farrah thinks learning new tricks is the absolute bee\u0027s knees. She\u0027s got an A+ sit and a solid B in leash walking. She is one of our TOP (Total Obedience Program) dogs, so she\u0027s also working on skills like coming when called, down and place. Though some might think that a 40-pound dog might not fit on their lap, Farrah is here to tell you different. She finds just the right amount of curled up and sprawled out to make sure your lap is never cold. She has a heart murmur, but it doesn\u0027t slow her down. Her spunky little attitude will always cheer you up. And kisses are absolutely included. The shelter is a pretty chaotic place for Farrah, so don\u0027t judge dogs by their kennel behavior. Farrah is home ready and knows the fine art of sleeping on soft beds and being a lovely companion."

    "description": "Darla lives a lifestyle that is pretty easy to maintain. Happy to snooze all day and play or go on a walk at night, she\u0027s a great pick for a 9-to-5-er. Though she is certainly mellow, she\u0027s still lots of fun. Darla is calm and quiet and likes to spend her time watching the world go by out the window. She is friendly and will make a great hostess when you have your friends over, greeting everyone and happily accepting back scratches. Darla has done great on sleepovers with our volunteers, and will even hop off the furniture when asked to do so. Darla loves squeakers, plays tug-of-war, and is always good for a cuddle. She\u0027s house trained and well-behaved when left alone in the home. Darla is not trying to rock the boat. So long as she\u0027s got naps, pets and a squeaky toy, she is pretty satisfied with things. Come meet her!"

    "description": "See Beryl\u0027s smile! It\u0027s proof that this happy boy is discovering a new and much improved life, one where he\u0027s given the attention he loves and wants. This energetic, affectionate boy came from a home with a disabled owner who was unable to give him attention and proper care. He was mostly left alone in a yard to entertain himself. Today Beryl is delighted to be learning what\u0027s it\u0027s like to be taken on walks, what playing fetch means and what toys are for. And most of all, he loves cuddling and belly rubs! He wants to follow his new human friends everywhere, sitting quietly at their feet getting head rubs, and then flipping over for those belly scratches. Beryl aspires to love and be loved by a companion who can continue to introduce him to new life experiences and give him the exercise he\u0027s lacked until now. Come take this boy for a walk and glow in that beautiful smile."

    "description": "Yancey is a sweet, mild-mannered lady who would love nothing more than to be your friend and playmate. She can\u0027t wait to meet her forever family that will give her the second chance and the loving family she deserves. Yancey can be a little shy but is learning to trust her people more and more every day. She\u0027s overjoyed to see her favorite people every time they walk through the door. That rewarding feeling will completely melt your heart! Yancey does well in her crate and walks calmly on her leash. She enjoys a good run or jog with her person and seems to smile when she\u0027s trotting along. If you\u0027re up for a quiet day, she\u0027s also the ultimate Netflix marathon companion and will gladly sit through just about anything! From her cute, stubby tail to the markings across her eyes that look like Phantom of the Opera, Yancey is full of tenderness, and she will make the perfect companion for the perfect person. Come meet sweet Yancey today! From Yancey\u0027s foster: \"Watching Yancey slowly warm up to you and come out of her shell is so rewarding. She went from a dog that wouldn\u0027t let me touch her to morning cuddles where she loves to be laying next to you on her back getting a belly rub. I think she could really benefit from a foster home where she can be gradually exposed to more humans and animals to hopefully become less shy She is very quiet. She doesn\u0027t bark even when other dogs bark at her. She loves going on long walks. She pulls on the leash some to go faster but not to pull away from me. I tell her to slow down and she normally does pretty quickly. She\u0027s very well house broken. She will stand at the door when she has to go out. And she will hold it for a really long time through the night. She loves to sleep in bed with you and will sleep in as long as you want. She has become quite the cuddler in the mornings before getting up. She will lay a paw across you in the mornings during cuddle sessions when she isn\u0027t quite ready to stop cuddling and get up. She is a very active dreamer and light snorer, especially when dreaming. It is very funny to watch her dream. She will play with stuffed toys by pouncing on them and throwing them up in the air and then running a few steps away from them. S he doesn\u0027t really want to engage with you during play more than you throwing the stuffed toy in the air to her (not fetch or tug of war). She seems a little uncertain if play is okay. She does well in a crate when left alone. It takes a little effort to get her in there but she does fine once in. She also does well in the car. She can jump up by herself and will go and lay down in the very back of the SUV. She is curious about the fast food windows but stays in the back and won\u0027t mess with your food. She will come check out what you are eating but has been very good about listening if I tell her no when she gets too close to my food (even when on the coffee table right at her nose).\""

    "description": "Angel Jack would settle for being a Happy Jack, and he\u0027s looking for a home where he could settle in. This compact-sized bundle of joy is sweet and friendly. He has lived in a home before, so we anticipate he will be well mannered and respectful - a great snuggling partner. He has a moderate energy level - he likes exercise but also needs plenty of beauty rest. At the shelter, his friends love his happy disposition - he loves to give affection to anyone he trusts. He loves to walk on a leash and will make a great exercise partner. Angel\u0027s beefy physique is no mistake - he is a treat-motivated, trainable dog. Got a snack for him? He\u0027s all yours! Angel Jack will repay your love and devotion with years of wonderful companionship. And don\u0027t forget that when you adopt from APA!, you\u0027re helping two dogs - the one you\u0027re welcoming into your home, and the next dog who will be able to join our program."

With those soulful puppy dog eyes and that prominent underbite, he has a way of pulling at our heartstrings. But don\u0027t be fooled! This fun-loving boy is all wiggles and wags when he\u0027s playing with toys or exploring the great outdoors. Runners and hikers, take note! if you\u0027re looking for the perfect trail companion, Monty is your boy. He goes out on the trail on a regular basis with his Virtual Foster friend. Together, they run side-by-side for miles. Bikers, strollers, dogs, cranky swans and other distractions don\u0027t phase him in the slightest. He truly is a fabulous workout buddy! So if you\u0027re looking for an athletic, sweet-natured, handsome boy, why not go the full Monty? If that face isn\u0027t enough to convince you to take him home immediately, we should also note that he has received rave reviews from his sleepover friend. He proved to be potty trained and a respectful houseguest. He\u0027s also an excellent snoozer and is content to lounge on the couch and keep you company for hours during Netflix marathons. In addition to being a top-notch lounger and trail companion, Monty is also in the Total Obedience Program. The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modelled after the AKC\u0027s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Monty has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help him learn the skills to become the best dog he can be! He is learning skills like sit and down, walking nicely on leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers or other dogs, staying in a sit or down until told \"free,\" and coming when called. Once Monty successfully completes all the skills on his/her training plan he will be considered TOP Dog Ready! Monty is working hard to become a wonderful pet and as a part of APA\u0027s Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with Monty after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA\u0027s CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https://vimeo.com/89434193 So what do you say? Want to come visit this sweet boy today? We have no doubt he will make his forever family very happy one day! Follow Monty on Instagram @ adopt_montythepit https://www.instagram.com/adopt_montythepit/?hl\u003den"

    "description": "Boris is very mature for his age! At only 3 years old he is a very relaxed, dainty gentleman. However, that doesn\u0027t mean he will not play Pirates of the Caribbean with you... ha! get it? Boris has a great sense of humor! He enjoys the occasional toy or rawhide for a little chewing and all the treats in China. That\u0027s the saying, right? He likes to go for leisurely walks making sure to smell the flowers along the way and only picks up speed when he spots a squirrel, lizard, or other such critter...to greet them, of course! After the walk, his fave thing to do is dip in the nearest watering hole to cool off. A car ride that leads him to an exploring adventure and you\u0027ve got the happiest dog on earth! Boris is super cuddly so If you like to watch movies or take naps, he is the perfect companion to cuddle up with on the sofa and do endless Netflix marathons. Texas fall is almost here (right?), so come snatch the perfect body pillow we have to offer."

    "description": "Aby is a lady with special needs, but she\u0027s such a mellow, cooperative girl that she makes caretaking a joy. This sweet girl was found on a street with three puppies and a paralyzed back end. What caused the injury is unknown; what is known is that she\u0027s adapting nicely to life with a disability. In foster care, Aby is learning to walk in her wheelchair and can even roughhouse with her foster dog buddies. She\u0027s happy to be outside watching them roll around playing, and she\u0027s also happy to be in the company of cats and kittens. Skittish at first with her new humans, she\u0027s warmed up and enjoys their petting. And she\u0027s a smart girl who listens well. Because of her paralysis, she wears a diaper; she comes when she hears \"Diaper change! and is very easy to change and carry on to the next adventure. Aby is a calm, easygoing girl who will do best in a quiet home with doggie playmates and maybe kitty buddies. Wouldn\u0027t you want to be the future of Aby\u0027s journey?"

You can read all her emotions just in the adorable way she perks her ears. Her gorgeous eyes truly seem to convey how much she loves you. Although she prefers to be the only animal in the house, she absolutely adores children! She is very well behaved when she\u0027s left along, and usually just occupies her time with naps or with her toys. She\u0027s also house trained and knows sit! Pebbles loves to run around the backyard, but is also up for a nice jog around the block. Walks can be a pretty entertaining endeavor as she gets a bit distracted by moving objects, specifically squirrels. She thinks they should all be her toys. She loves toys, and when she\u0027s playing that is her only focus. She has the most enthusiastic energy and really just loves to play and have fun! This sweet girl is the affection queen! She is so devoted to her people, and prefers to be as close to them as she can be. She is the best napping buddy, and loves to lay her head in your lap. She\u0027ll even let you rest your head on her if you\u0027re sleepy! Her current foster says she tries to get work done, and if Pebbles jumps up beside her it\u0027s nearly impossible to resist putting work away and snuggling. Pebbles\u0027 ideal home would have a roomy backyard where she can really stretch those athletic legs. She would also love to have a family that is able to spend lots of time with her, and give her lots of attention. She is so full of love and loyalty and cannot wait to show her forever family just what an amazing companion she is. Come meet Pebbles! Her joy really is contagious!"

His recovery has been remarkable, and now he is ready to conquer his way to a warm, cozy final destination: his own home. Through it all, Jabba has kept his dandy looks. His soft fur is growing back and he is being a champ at eating well and taking his medications. As most of us know, some ailments come along with age, but they are not an obstacle in Jabba\u0027s journey to find his forever family. Little Jabba is mellow and low energy, but he gets a little bolder each day. He loves chin and belly rubs, and will show his love and gratitude with a little kiss here and there. Jabba the Mutt has been through so much. He deserves to spend the rest of his days surrounded by people that adore him, a plushy pillow, all the treats and the certainty that there will never be a bad day, because he is home."

And she mostly ignores the cat. She prefers cuddles and attention from her human friends, especially gentle petting and being carried around, giving those gentle kisses. Phoebe is crate trained, although she really wants to be where her people are, trailing them around the house and yard. Playing is not her thing, so she doesn\u0027t require toys. This loving, trusting, happy lady would love to live her golden years in a home with new humans who are home most of the time, and maybe with friendly, gentle dog and cat companions. Come meet this sweet, adorable girl."

    "description": "Winter is coming, so if you\u0027d like a large, snuggly foot warmer under your desk while you work, come meet Joey. This laidback boy is comfortable lounging around the house. Then in the afternoon, he\u0027s ready to play, fetching his kong bone and up for long, fast walks. At night, he\u0027s sleeping in his crate. And he\u0027s house trained! Once Joey\u0027s acquainted with new humans, he bonds quickly and becomes a really good companion who loves belly rubs and playing with kids. Being a big boy, he would love a home with a yard to roam and one with loving companions to go on those walks. Come meet him and see if he\u0027s perfect for your family."

    "description": "\"Rowdy is an overstatement, but this young feller is looking for an active, fun household where he will happily serve as your co-pilot. Rowdy has been spending time in an APA! foster home, so he knows his way around a home. He\u0027s good in a crate, house-trained, and he knows basic commands. He\u0027s a smart young adult who learns quickly, and he\u0027d love to receive more training. He also loves to receive petting, and likes to stay close to his favorite people. But it\u0027s outdoors where Rowdy is really at home. He loves to be outside running around the yard, exploring, and generally having a good time. He\u0027s improving his leash manners, and will make a great walking partner - and he\u0027ll definitely be up for running too! At this stage of life, Rowdy has plenty of energy and would love to live with an active family who could help him stay on the move. He\u0027ll repay you with years of wonderful companionship, and plenty of affection. If you love active Austin, this would be the perfect dog to have at your side. And don\u0027t forget that when you adopt from APA!, you\u0027re helping two dogs - the one you\u0027re welcoming into your home, and the next dog who will be able to join our program."

This sweet, affectionate dog also wriggles a lot when he gets that attention he loves, following his foster mom all around the house. But then he\u0027s also a chill dog who\u0027s happy to lounge with his people, getting their petting. And he loves going for car rides. Grape gets along well with other dogs and loves going for brisk walks with his people, walking very well on his leash. He answers to the \u0027sit\u0027 and \u0027shake\u0027 commands and is house-trained. And he\u0027s very polite and won\u0027t get up on the furniture. This playful boy also likes his rope toy, playing tug with it, tossing it around and running after it. Grape is a loving, easygoing guy who is doing well in an apartment, and would also love a home with a yard to roam. And one with a dog buddy or two to play with would be ideal. Come meet this adorable, smiley boy!"

    "description": "All dogs are special in their own way. Some of just wear their \u0027special\u0027 a little more obviously. Unlike most dogs his age, Spencer is strong and full of energy. And age is really just a number, isn\u0027t it? He\u0027s very capable of playing and having fun whether he\u0027s using \u0027his wheels\u0027 or scooting around without them. In fact, his wheels are such a part of Spencer that you might even forget that he has them (he definitely does sometimes). Just like other dogs, he likes to be scratched and rubbed and loves to play fetch. He\u0027s also really good with other dogs and kids, the more the merrier. So, if you have a backyard and a great big heart that are both missing a little something special, come check him out. With a few years under his belt, Spencer has learned the value of love from a good human. If you are looking for a special furry friend who is loyal, obedient and adoring...look no further. Spencer\u0027s your guy."

    "description": "Stewart is an adorably silly miniature poodle, who came to Austin Pets Alive with a neurological condition rendering him unable to walk, made worse by a terrible ear infection. As his ear infection was treated and resolved, his mobility improved. Stewart is still a sideways kinda dog...he leans to the left and will topple over often, but he trots around his foster mom\u0027s yard like he owns the place...even when he falls he just keeps on going. While it\u0027s unclear exactly what has made Stewart so wobbly, it was likely caused by either trauma or a stroke. No matter the cause, he is easily managed. He only weighs about 6 lbs, so when he needs to be carried it\u0027s no problem at all. His foster mom notes that he is an enthusiastic eater and prefers eating laying down. He is offered water several times a day (he has trouble getting to the water bowl on his own), and is house trained, though he should be carried outside to potty. Stewart does not walk on a leash, but he should be carefully watched when outside because he does scoot around quite fast, and his person should be nearby when he potties to help prop him upright \u0026 ensure he doesn\u0027t fall over when he goes (and doesn\u0027t soil himself). Stewart currently lives with 2 other small dogs who are careful not to trample him and share laptime. He also lives with cats, who he mostly ignores except when he feels like barking at them. We don\u0027t know what kind of family Stewart had in a prior life, but his new family will need to provide a little bit of extra attention and care to keep him clean \u0026 groomed (he will need a groomer who can carefully manage his inability to stand without support). If you think you can provide the extra care Stewart needs, we are sure you\u0027ll be delighted."

This healthy young adult would make a great match for an active family looking for an exercise partner. He\u0027ll join you on any walk, and isn\u0027t opposed to a run. In fact, he enjoys running around playing chase with his volunteer friends. Did we mention he is friendly? He assists to our daily playgroup where he has doggie friends that he romps around with. As for his people, he\u0027s been a real loverboy with everyone he meets - he loves being around all kinds of people and can\u0027t wait to share some affection! Knighten enjoys learning new things and is in the Total Obedience Program. The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modelled after the AKC\u0027s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Knighten has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help him/her learn the skills to become the best dog he can be! He is learning skills like sit and down, walking nicely on leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers or other dogs, staying in a sit or down until told \"free,\" and coming when called. Once Knighten successfully completes all the skills on his training plan he will be considered TOP Dog Ready! Knighten is working hard to become a wonderful pet and as a part of APA\u0027s Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with Knighten after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA\u0027s CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https://vimeo.com/89434193 This wonderful boy will bring smiles to his new family for years to come!"

    "description": "Don\u0027t let the white whiskers fool you! This playful pup is full of life and ready to show you a good time! This fun-loving six-year-old has plenty of energy and loves entertaining himself with tennis balls and going on long walks with his human friends. It doesn\u0027t take long for Pete too warm up to people people - especially if you have treats. When he leans up against you, it\u0027s official - you\u0027ve got a friend for life. Since he\u0027s a fan of snacks, he\u0027s highly trainable and loves working on his skills. He\u0027s already mastered a number of skills, including \"sit,\" \"stay,\" and \"shake.\" Though he\u0027s a mid-sized retriever, Pete is convinced he\u0027s a lap dog. Once he snuggles up with you, get ready for some sloppy kisses. It\u0027s hard not to laugh when he channels his inner puppy and goes into full playtime mode. It\u0027s time for Pete to find his forever home, where he will undoubtedly make his family very happy. He appears to be potty trained and could potentially go home to a well-matched doggie sibling. So what do you say? Why not visit Pete today? We dare you not to fall in love at first kiss!"

She\u0027s a versatile lady who loves being a couch potato or going for runs. After a run, she likes to cool off in water-it may be sprinklers or she may try to join you in the shower! When she\u0027s nice and clean, she\u0027ll snuggle up with a squeaky toy. If you have a busy day planned, Genoa is content in the house and able to be left alone. She is currently recovering nicely in the shelter from a recent eye surgery to fix her entropion. Come meet this lady and make her your own."

    "description": "Make way for Lucinda! This worthy dog is one of our favorites. We\u0027d like to see her come out of our shelter like a rose, and find a great family. Don\u0027t go all the way to the Crescent City to find your next dog. Lucinda is a sweet, fun dog who would love a chance to meet your family. Lucinda has lived in a home before and knows her way around. She has solid leash manners, and should make a great walking partner. And after the walk, she\u0027ll just ask for water. But take care walking her along the side of the road, because she loves going for car rides and wants to jump into back seats. And then you\u0027ll have to roll down the windows, because she loves to feel the breeze! Lucinda also loves to get in some exercise by playing fetch. You\u0027ll give her the big red sun blues if you don\u0027t throw her a few tennis balls every day. Is the night too long for her? Hardly. Lucinda likes to stay somewhat active with walk and play time, but she also enjoys her beauty sleep. She\u0027s got a medium energy level that will be a great match for a somewhat active home. Did we mention that Lucinda is a people lover? You can expect some passionate kisses from her. Who can blame her? She just wanted to see you so bad! She\u0027s got a great disposition; she seems to always be in a good mood (and on the hunt for her next belly rub). We think she would be a good candidate to share a home with kids. Lucinda enjoys learning new things and is in the Total Obedience Program. The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modelled after the AKC\u0027s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Lucinda has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help her learn the skills to become the best dog she can be! She is learning skills like sit and down, walking nicely on leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers or other dogs, staying in a sit or down until told \"free,\" and coming when called. Once Lucinda successfully completes all the skills on her training plan she will be considered TOP Dog Ready! Lucinda is working hard to become a wonderful pet and as a part of APA\u0027s Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with Lucinda after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA\u0027s CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https://vimeo.com/89434193"

    "description": "Laverne recently lost her best doggie buddy, Shirley. On her own for the first time, Laverne is a sweet, trusting soul who is finding her way through her first solo gig. She could use a friend. She makes a great one. Laverne is a mellow dog is who is mostly content to nap and follow you around. After a little adjusting to life without her bestie, she now is excited whenever her foster mom comes home from work, greeting at the door, tail wagging. Laverne is housetrained and has excellent manners in the house. She seems to prefer hard floors to couches, though her foster mom finally got her to use the doggie bed after it was placed near the people bed where she likes to sleep. But if you are worried about pets on your furniture, she\u0027s a good fit. Laverne\u0027s a low maintenance girl looking for a low maintenance life to match. If that fits your lifestyle, come meet her!"

    "description": "Eva is quirky, pint sized senior pooch. This sweet lady has been through a lot recently, coming into APA with a head injury after being hit by a car. Although she\u0027s seen a lot, this sassy girl still has a lot of pizazz! She even rocks a pretty cool Mohawk, and lives every day to its fullest! Eva wants very much to be loved. It takes some slow TLC to gain her trust, as she doesn\u0027t always know what people around her will do, but once she knows you\u0027re full of kindness and want to show her affection, she\u0027ll be your friend for life! This laid-back pooch is a big fan of her relaxation time. She adores her naps, and after a few walks throughout the day, and some adorable morning bouncy time she definitely needs it. Her current foster says Eva doesn\u0027t seem to understand what toys are for, and sometimes gets a bit nervous when someone tries to play with her. She much prefers her cuddling time, and is full of sweet kisses! As long as someone\u0027s petting her, she will constantly be in laps. If the petting stops, she\u0027ll tap you on the hand as if to say, \"a little more, please. If that doesn\u0027t work, she\u0027ll gladly hop down to nap in her doggy bed. She loves to wake her person up in the mornings touching her nose to theirs. A more endearing wake up, there never was! Eva would do wonderfully in a quieter household and may do well with other low-key dogs who will give her her space. She is so full of love, and really deserves a home in her retirement years that will cover her in love and affection. This sweet, gentle girl just wants to kick back and relax with her forever family for the rest of her days. Come meet Eva, you\u0027ll adore her kisses and her awesome hairdo!"

    "description": "Do you like swimming? Do you have a pool? If so, have we got the perfect swimming partner for you! Meet Starfish. Starfish is the oldest known dog to have swimmer\u0027s syndrome and survive to be a year old. Swimmer\u0027s Syndrome is a birth defect that is usually treated and recovered from as an infant pup. (see http://www.thedogplace.org/REPRODUCTION/Swimmer-Pup-Syndrome_Lanting-1310.asp) In Starfish\u0027s case it does not appear she was treated. Instead at around 6 months old she was found in a box in a park. It was quickly discovered that she was suffering from advanced swimmer\u0027s syndrome. Starfish immediately had all 4 legs placed in casts and bound together to attempt to resolve the issue quickly. Starfish showed a desire to eat her way out of any restraints she was placed in so alternate treatment methods were created. Multiple special items have been made for her to help her be able to be off of the ground and attempt to have a somewhat normal life while also having her legs bound together. At this point, Starfish is able to hold herself up on her back legs and is able to move herself around with her back legs as the main support and then her front legs, while bound together, act as a \"tripod\" effect for her. Starfish has a very devoted and dedicated neurotherapist who will continue to see her locally until she is recovered. She has also had consults at veterinarian practices who have suggested acupuncture and laser therapy along with the binding of her front legs. Through all of this Starfish\u0027s personality and spirit has remained happy and loving. She is an absolute doll to snuggle with and if you love the way a train sounds, then you will laugh at her snorty snorts that occur throughout the day! Starfish currently is living in a foster home that has introduced her to many things. She has lived with dogs, cats, infants, toddlers, rabbits, chinchillas, and pot belly pigs. Starfish does very well in her foster home with meeting new animals, but her foster family also is a very experienced family and knows how to manage her. Outside of the foster home her level of tolerance is much lower and she has shown some reactivity. She is currently working with the behavior team to help work through her fear based issues with meeting new animals outside of her home. If you have another animal or animals it will be suggested that several meetings occur with the behavior team and Starfish and your animal(s). If you are an only dog home, you are a couch potato that likes to swim in your backyard pool, and you are looking for a one of a kind lifelong friend, then Starfish is your girl! Even if you have no pool, she would love to meet you still! Please contact us if you would like to hear more about our one of a kind amazing miracle girl!"

They are so soulful and expressive, you will never have to wonder what Flora is thinking. And most of the time, she is thinking LOVE. Flora is house trained, calm in her crate and knows sit and shake. Her favorite game is tug of war, but fetch is fast catching up, if she ever fully gets the hang of it. She\u0027s pretty close. Though she loves to play, her most favorite thing is being next to her people. If she has her way, she would always have a least one little bit of her touching you. Her paw, her head, the tip of her tail. She loves to know you are close and safe. Flora is a sweet, trusting and adoring soul who deserves a great family to love on. Come meet her!"

    "description": "Alonso is one of the most people-oriented dogs you\u0027ve ever met. If you\u0027re sitting, he\u0027s hopping up on your lap. If you\u0027re standing, he\u0027s gazing up at you adoringly (especially if you happen to be standing near the kitchen). If you\u0027ll let him nap with you, he\u0027ll curl up, use you as a pillow, and snore the hours away. But he\u0027s not a one-person type of pup - he loves everybody. He\u0027s an active guy: he loves chewing on a bone, massacring a squeaky toy, etc. He\u0027s got a bit of a bum leg right now that the APA medical team is going to look at, but he\u0027s not letting it slow him down. He loves going on the trail, wading in shallow water, and rolling around in the grass. When he\u0027s back to his fully-four-legged-self, I think he\u0027d be an awesome running and hiking companion. Alonso does have epilepsy, but is on meds managing the issue. He takes his meds like a champ, so that\u0027s a non-issue. That epilepsy doesn\u0027t take away from his zest for life--he\u0027s a loving, fun, active dog on every front. I don\u0027t know how you don\u0027t love a guy like this!"

    "description": "Donatello loves three things; napping, snuggling and his best friend Leonardo. Everything else, he is equally happy to take or leave. Donatello follows you around until you\u0027re ready to stop and snuggle with him! He loves being in your lap and relaxing with you. He\u0027s loyal because he wants to be with you more than anything else! Donatello is good at eating, he\u0027s very house-trained and it\u0027s impressive how quickly he will go to bathroom outside. Donatello LOVES TO CUDDLE! This is his favorite thing to do, and he pretty much wants to cuddle with every person he meets. He loves being pet and sitting next to people or in their laps. He also seems to like being carried around in your arms. He is very bonded to his best friend Leonardo, and they cuddle together a lot too. But he is polite around all creatures, including cats. His favorite person is the one who is allowing him to snuggle at any given moment. He is not picky. You got a lap, Donatello is here for it. He is good in his crate, house trained and walks well on a leash. He will follow you everywhere, waiting for you to sit down so he can snuggle some more. If you are a human of simple pleasures, then Donatello is your dog. NOTE: Donatello is part of a bonded pair with Leonardo and they must be adopted together."

Leonardo is house trained, good in a crate and walks well on a leash. Though he is polite around most creatures, including cats, he would rather just hang out with Donatello.

    "description": "Hurricane Harvey was approaching Houston when an APA volunteer arrived at a shelter, loaded Feebee and other dogs in her car and zoomed them back to Austin and safety. Now this sweet rescued girl is starting her new and secure life in foster care in her rescuer\u0027s home, where she\u0027s finding so many interesting things to explore outdoors and so many toys to fetch inside. So many good times to have! Feebee is such a busy, active girl, standing on her hind legs to look out the window and watch those birds. Then she begs her humans to go out to run and play. Indoors, just ask her to fetch her monkey and she obeys, then drops it at her human\u0027s feet for another throw. When playtime is done, she\u0027s ready to sleep next to her people to get their petting and give them kisses. She\u0027s also very smart and is already crate-trained and great on leash. This social butterfly is looking for a forever home where she can romp with active humans and doggie playmates. One with a fenced yard to roam would be ideal. Come take this girl for a walk - right to your home!"

    "description": "Lazlo is a gentle old soul that is faithful and loyal to his core! Being rescued after Hurricane Harvey, this sweet guy has really been put through the ringer. His deep expressive eyes seem to tell a story of resilience. In spite of his struggles, this loving senior pooch has a joyful optimism that he\u0027ll find a wonderful companion to share his retirement years with. Lazlo is an angel in his crate and has fully mastered leash training. He has wonderful manners, never cries or chews, is house-trained and enjoys relaxing and naptime almost as much as he adores his people! Little Lazlo is an extremely talented shadow, following his people around wherever they go. His favorite pastimes are laying in laps and snuggling up on the couch. Lazlo has a loyalty to his people when he knows he\u0027s being taken care of and his entire world revolves around loving them. His current foster describes him as wanting to protect and love her always. Once you have gained his trust, this love bug will make sure you know his heart belongs to you. Having Lazlo in your life is incredibly rewarding, and his joy is contagious to say the least. Lazlo loves going for walks and has the most adorable energetic prance. He likes to fetch soft toys, but otherwise prefers to spend his time relaxing. He radiates bliss and contentment, knowing that all is right in his world when he\u0027s with his human. Even though he\u0027s in his senior years, deep down, there\u0027s a playful puppy who exudes love and gratitude that he\u0027s no longer in a tough situation. And he has the cutest little foxy ears that will absolutely melt your heart! Lazlo would do wonderfully in a home where he\u0027s the only animal as he\u0027s been on his own for so long. A calm, low traffic home would be perfect for him. This gentle little pooch would really thrive with someone that is able to hang out with him throughout the day, and is willing to take him on car rides. He still loves a good adventure, and really just wants to be the ultimate side kick! This faithful guy deserves the biggest second chance to live out his retirement in a loving home. Lazlo has the biggest heart and will never give up finding love. If you come meet him, he\u0027ll show you that he can be the best friend you\u0027ve ever had! He promises to give you his whole heart for the rest of his days!"

    "description": "Jennifer has some vision loss that may not return but that doesn\u0027t stop her! She learns quickly and navigates her surroundings well that you almost can\u0027t tell. Despite this, she is a little hesitant around new dogs but will warm up to them. Jennifer is a happy, fearless, loving, adventurous soul and just needs a family with lots of love and time to spend with her! Jennifer will get bursts of playfulness but mostly wants to sleep on the couch. Jennifer likes to be around people and will curl into a ball on the couch next to you, but is not overly affectionate. She walks very politely on the Easy Walk halter and is working on sit and come. She is create-trained, often returning to her crate on her own. Jennifer is a young lady who\u0027s eager to explore this new world she inhabits, whether it\u0027s searching through and around all those household objects or going for walks on her leash. Come visit Jennifer and see if you can give her the love she deserves."

    "description": "If you\u0027re looking for a young dog with a huge heart, look no further than Scott. This little guy soaks up affection like a sponge, following his fosters around the house and diving in for snuggles at every possible opportunity. If his cuddles and adorable face don\u0027t win you over, his inquisitive and playful personality certainly will. Just watch him cock his head and furrow his brow like a human when he\u0027s puzzling over something new he\u0027s discovered! Scott is a total gentleman with kids of all ages and other dogs. Though he\u0027s still young and not fully trained, he is eager to please and learning fast. Scott is already picking up leash etiquette, learning how to sit on command, and always stops what he\u0027s doing with just a simple \"no. Scott was evacuated from a shelter in Port Aransas before Hurricane Harvey. Though we don\u0027t know much about his past, we do know that his future is bright. Contact APA! to meet this playful pup (and, dare we say, \"beam him up) today!"

    "description": "Mercer is a chill dog who asks very little of his human friends. Just your attention and affection - and sometimes whatever you\u0027re eating. This huggable pup is a rescue from Hurricane Harvey who\u0027s now in Austin sharing his foster home with two dogs and getting along well with them. He mostly wants to be with his new human, looking at her as though she\u0027s his whole world. He\u0027s a calm boy who gets a little burst of energy when he wants to play, and he walks well on his leash. He does well in his crate and is house trained. And like a teething baby, he loves chewing on bones. Mercer is a loving, lovable pup who is looking for a home with all that affection he wants. Come meet him!"

    "description": "Barbie the most gentle, sweet pooch! This resilient girl is a Hurricane Harvey survivor, and was a long-time stray prior to that. She has had a tough life, but her bright expressive eyes exude pure love and affection. It will completely win your heart! She is an absolute angel in her crate, and is working on her \"sit, stay, lay down, and \"heel commands. She\u0027s house trained and absolutely mild mannered to her core. Barbie is so attentive, and even if she doesn\u0027t know an exact command, she\u0027ll do her best to follow instructions, and is amazingly well behaved. This affectionate lady loves to be petted and loves to be close to her person. She loves to sleep with her people at night, if they\u0027re ok with it, and will always be near if they\u0027re sitting at a desk or another chair. This sweet girl loves her people so much, she will follow them around and will keep a close protective eye on their every move. When you come home, she will do a comical bounce and bat her paws around. It\u0027s pretty endearing! Barbie loves to be lazy, and her sleep time is something she thoroughly cherishes! She likes to go on walks for a while, but eventually will hilariously try and turn around to go home. After a long snooze, she also can get pretty playful, but settles down very quickly again. Her current foster says that Barbie doesn\u0027t like to get her feet wet, and when it\u0027s raining really pushes how long before she\u0027s willing to go out and take care of her business. She can be quite the silly pooch. Barbie is such a sweetheart, and she deserves to feel the reassurance that her love will be reciprocated. She would probably thrive in a home where she\u0027s the only other dog, as she hasn\u0027t been around many in her life. Mostly, Barbie just wants a home with soft spaces where she can nap, and a loving family that will adore her for all her days! Come meet Barbie! Her deep beautiful eyes will melt you to the core!"

    "description": "Kobu really wants to make your acquaintance. This handsome, funny, goofy, loyal and protective boy is one who takes a little time to warm up to a stranger, but when he does, the time you have invested in him is well rewarded with wiggles and affection. Kobu is hoping you are the person/family who will take a chance on him. He wants you to come and visit for some meet and greets so he can get to know you and he can let his charming personality be known as he slowly makes you his special friend(s). As his foster mom states, \"he will have your back forever. Kobu has medium energy and enjoys jumping and playing with all manner of toys, but he also enjoys simple hangout time too. He has great leash skills and is non reactive to people, cats and dogs when on a walk. He is soooo smart. He knows a ton of commands, such as \u0027come\u0027, \u0027sit\u0027, \u0027down\u0027, \u0027rollover\u0027, \u0027place\u0027, \u0027shake\u0027 and \u0027drop\u0027. Whew...and he\u0027s ready to learn everything else you want to teach him. Kobu is nervous around other dogs though better with smaller and daintier ones. He hasn\u0027t been fully observed with cats but mostly seems to ignore them when out on walks. If you love bringing out the best in others, come meet Kobu a few times and see how a little trust and love can do wonders for this faithful fellow."

    "description": "Burgundy is another Gulf transplant from the recent hurricane, and we\u0027re happy to welcome her to Austin. We see a lot of sweet, friendly dogs, but Burgundy\u0027s disposition really stands out. She is gentle and loving with pretty much everyone she meets. We\u0027re not sure of her full history, but it seems like she\u0027s been in a home before. She learns the rules quickly, she\u0027s fully housebroken, and she\u0027s usually quiet around the house. Her foster has said that they\u0027ve barely heard her bark. She\u0027s also a smart, perceptive dog and can read human body language like nobody\u0027s business. Burgundy has a moderate energy level - she loves going for walks, although she prefers to keep them to shorter distances. Her other main exercise outlet is chasing around the ol\u0027 tennis ball. She is great at fetch and likes to keep the game going for a while. Burgundy seems like a versatile dog who will be able to fit into most family environments, though we think she would prefer a home where she could receive (and provide) a lot of companionship. She\u0027s looking forward to moving to her permanent home, and doesn\u0027t seem too picky! And don\u0027t forget that when you adopt from APA!, you\u0027re helping two dogs - the one you\u0027re welcoming into your home, and the next dog who will be able to join our program."

    "description": "Hurricane Harvey survivor Brazil is a lover of all humans, cuddles, and play time. He is curious about most things \u0026 spends most of his walks smelling everything he passes. He is really just a big ball of joy who thinks he\u0027s a lap dog. Brazil loves laying on the couch or the bed but gets off quick if you tell him no. He loves to be around the action and is going to want to be an active participant in the lives of his forever family. Brazil loves tennis balls but fetching isn\u0027t his forte. You\u0027ll often find him with a ball in one side of his mouth and his tongue hanging out the other. Brazil is not too sure how to sit or stay but he works hard on it everyday. He is housebroken, crate trained, and very well behaved in a home environment. He never barks or growls but he\u0027ll get you with those puppy dog eyes if he wants to go out. Brazil was rescued from Houston in late August and is ready to give you lots of love!"

    "description": "Bowen is a curious, energetic, people-lover! He was rescued in Houston after Hurricane Harvey, and is a total trooper. His expressive eyes seem to be saying \"please play with me...or accidentally drop your sandwich! Either one will make me the happiest dog in the world! This friendly guy is great with other dogs, and is also a fan of children! He is quickly learning his leash skills, and we know it won\u0027t take him long to also master house training. He does well in his crate as long as he\u0027s alone at home. He gets sad if he\u0027s locked up and knows that his people are nearby. If he had his way, he\u0027d be permanently attached to his person\u0027s side! He is the king of cuddling, and is a big fan of napping with his head on laps, or snuggled up to his canine siblings. He loves being with his people so much, that his current foster says he stands guard and chases the bubbles from her hot tub! Bowen also adores the water hose, and would probably enjoy swimming, although he hasn\u0027t been yet. Active and curious are two characteristics that Bowen completely embodies! He loves to run laps in the backyard, and will play until he is totally beat. He\u0027s always happy to chase balls, play tug of war with his ropes, and chew on bones. This funny guy feels the responsibility to explore every inch of the house, the yard, and every bush on a walk. He is incredibly aware of his surroundings, and adorably observant! Bowen is full of sweetness, and such a great companion. He cannot wait to meet his forever family and start showing his love and affection for them! His ideal home would let him join in on any family adventures. He reveres his outside time, and would be thrilled if he joined a family that appreciated that. Mostly, Bowen just wants a home that will love him forever! Come meet Bowen! He promises to be the best friend he can be!"

    "description": "If you want to make Bunny happy, show her a water hose. Then turn it on. This sweet girl is a Hurricane Harvey rescue who may not like floods, but she absolutely loves being sprayed with water from that hose, jumping and playing and even standing on her hind legs. Bunny is a playful, energetic girl who also loves hiking and running outdoors, stopping to smell everything she sees, then running some more. She especially loves playing with other dogs, and she\u0027s a gentle playmate who also lets kids pet on her. Now in foster care, this lovebug also wants to cuddle on the couch or bed with her human friends with her head in their laps, getting her belly rubbed. Bunny is well behaved in the home and is house trained. She answers to the \u0027sit,\u0027 \u0027no\u0027 and \u0027come\u0027 commands and is working on her leash training. This affectionate girl is looking for a home where she can get that exercise and attention she adores from loving adopters and playtime with doggie housemates. Come meet this girl!"

    "description": "If a facial expression is worth a thousand words, Donnie is a four legged dictionary. He knows how to work those hazel eyes and he\u0027s not afraid to throw in a head tilt or eyebrow lift to finish off melting your heart. He really aims to please and will constantly check in with you, seeking your approval. Donnie is a 4 year old lab mix that wants to be by his human\u0027s side for everything life throws at you. He\u0027s a versatile companion. He enjoys lounging at home snuggling with his human, going glamping, going on jogs through serene trails, letting his jowels flap in the wind on road trips, and having a few material items to call his own. Like a fold up chair. He doesn\u0027t believe he should be expected to lay or sit on the ground. Donnie is crate trained and house trained. He\u0027s never once had an accident inside and will wait for you to show him exactly where it\u0027s acceptable to go to the bathroom when exploring new places. Donnie loves kids and adults alike and he handles other dogs well out on the town. Donnie would be a good fit for any active person or family."

She\u0027s a bit cautious, loyal to the people and dogs she loves, and always does her best not to cause any trouble. But when she is among friends, she lets her playful, goofy side through. Virgil is crate trained, and loves having a little safe space to call her own. She\u0027s great with other dogs and loves to play in the yard. She loves to give tiny, demure kisses to let you know she appreciates you. Everything she does, she does with grace and a sense of calm.

    "description": "If you would like a companion in your office all day who\u0027s more sociable and good natured than your co-workers, come meet Virgo. This gentleman goes to work with his foster mom, and her co-workers are so impressed by how quiet and well-behaved he is. He\u0027s due for a raise! Virgo came from a Houston shelter in the wake of Hurricane Harvey. Today, he\u0027s in foster with two other dogs and getting along amazingly well with both. He would be happy to stay home all day to snuggle on the couch with his human friends, loving those pets and belly rubs. If they stop, he nudges their hands to get them started again, then rolls over for more. And if his people are busy, he\u0027s also happy to chew on soft toys and nylabones, sometimes handing a toy to his human for a toss and fetch. Virgo is house trained and can be left alone at home with no destructive behavior. He also walks well on his leash, without reacting to other animals he sees. This easygoing, lovable boy should do well in any home, so come meet him and see how well he\u0027ll fit under your desk."

    "description": "Bertha is a calm, peaceful girl who spends much of her time waiting at a window watching for her human friends to come home. And she\u0027s so happy to see them, wiggling and offering her head for pets! This shy, sweet girl was rescued in Houston from Hurricane Harvey and brought to Austin, where she\u0027s now happy to lounge in foster care and following her new people from room to room. She\u0027s a well-behaved, house trained girl who asks for very little activity or entertainment. Bertha hasn\u0027t been observed with dogs other than those encountered on walks, but she\u0027s living with two cats and getting along well with them. And she\u0027s living nicely with a rambunctious 5-year-old child, not bothered by him at all. This easygoing, low-maintenance girl should fit well into homes with gentle people who will return her love. Come meet her today!"

    "description": "Buddha is all about love. He will come over to where you\u0027re sitting to give you a body hug and kisses. It\u0027ll make your day! He does great in the home and is already crate-trained. Buddha loves to fetch and will even bring the ball right back to you. Squeaky toys are his kryptonite and can keep him busy for awhile. His mega-watt smile catches people\u0027s attention when he walks around the neighborhood. He\u0027s an adventurer, enjoying the sights and sounds around him. He can be a chill, yet curious dude. His favorite past time is to observe people passing by. He\u0027s treat motivated and will follow you around with big puppy eyes in case you would like to share a yummy morsel. That should make teaching him new skills pretty easy. He already knows sit and is easy to leash up. Buddha is ready to be someone\u0027s best friend and companion. Give him a chance to be yours!"

    "description": "Tanner Dog is a boy rescued from Hurricane Harvey and now off to a new life that he hopes will make him someone\u0027s favorite lapdog. He does understand that he\u0027s a bit large to be a lapdog, so he will settle for cuddles and lots of belly rubs. And hugs and kisses; he gives lots of those, too. This loving and lovable boy is in foster care, where he\u0027s always very excited to see his new human friends arrive home. He then follows them around the house - except when he wants to run and play with the household dogs. He loves them, too! Tanner is a friendly boy who\u0027s crate trained and walks nicely on his leash. When the walks are over, he\u0027s happy to settle down and watch TV with his humans. Come meet this boy and see if he\u0027s perfect for your home."

    "description": "From Hunny\u0027s foster: \"Hunny is very sweet and has a very calm demeanor. I live downtown so everything down here is new to her and she\u0027s doing a great job with stairs, elevators, town lake trail and all the hustle and bustle of downtown. She loves to turn around and look at you with a big smile while she\u0027s on a walk. She\u0027s also happy to just hang out and chew on a rawhide. She\u0027s really good at taking naps too! If you give her a really good butt scratch or petting, she\u0027ll follow you around for a good 10 minutes. Then she will easily go back to her bed and hang out at your feet. She seems to respond fairly well to verbal cues like \"stop\", \"slow\" and \"this way\". She has only passed kids on the street on leash and has no reactivity. She met two small dogs yesterday on leash and seemed to enjoy them. Ultimately, I think she\u0027d be perfectly happy with a back yard, a few walks, children who understand that she\u0027s still a little timid and shy - so she\u0027s not going to be a lover right away. But she\u0027s coming around to me every day more and more. She would probably be great with dogs who have her same energy level.\" Hunny is a beautiful wall flower. It\u0027s easy to pass her by because she\u0027s so quiet and reserved around people she doesn\u0027t know. But once she knows you are a friend, she blossoms. Hunny is smart and observant. She\u0027s pretty tuned in to what her human wants, and adapted to walking both in the heart of the city and on the trails quickly. She prefers a bit of nature. She\u0027s a bit of a hippie chick. She is housetrained, well-behaved when left alone, and is about a medium energy dog. She is happy to nap all day but really appreciates a good walk. She even seems to know some commands like \"stop.\" Her favorite things are raw hides and butt scratches, and those things are the shortcut to her heart. Hunny doesn\u0027t open up to just anyone but she is well worth the effort. Come meet her!"

    "description": "Davina is a terrific family dog in search of a family. She has a lot of energy but is usually good at reading a room - not too rough with kids but lets loose with other like-minded dogs. She thrives on affection and wants to know that she is a good girl. Davina would be happiest in a home with some action in it most of the time, be it people, kids or other dogs. She will need to be exercised daily, but a good run in the yard or a walk around the block is enough. She\u0027s smart and sensitive, the kind of dog where it is easy to imagine her inner monologue. And she\u0027s usually thinking, \"Life is pretty good.\" Any family would be lucky to add Davina to their ranks. Come meet her!"

    "description": "In addition to being a lovable boy, Hashi is an entertaining housemate. He enjoys having a silly good time, sometimes chasing his tail and hoping to be rewarded with lots of head scratches. This sweet, super affectionate boy loves to meet new humans, and he\u0027s very excited to get petting from them. Every sort of loving attention is appreciated. Hashi is a chill, laidback dog who does well in his crate, is house-trained, walks well on his leash (until he sees a cat or squirrel) and answers to the \u0027stay\u0027 and \u0027come\u0027 commands. Hashi does have a heart condition but it is easily managed with medication. Now in foster care, Hashi isn\u0027t particular about a future home - he can do well in an apartment, or a home with a yard would be a plus. Come meet this cutie!"

    "description": "Camille is a shy young girl who\u0027s just now learning that the world is not as scary as she once thought. She\u0027s already found out that if she flips over with her tummy up, humans will give her belly rubs. Oh, boy! She\u0027ll happily accept them all day long, especially if they come from a person as calm and gentle as she is. This sweet girl is looking for a home with those gentle people who will keep helping her gain confidence. Come meet her!"

    "description": "Possum is a special gal looking for a special human or family willing to give her a little time to come out of her shell with consistency and loving understanding. Though a little tepid at first, once she feels comfortable in her environment she\u0027s pretty independent and curious. She is deaf and mostly blind, though she has a little sight from her left eye and if you make eye contact with her she drinks you in. Caution, this could cause a heart to burst! Despite being limited to her sense of smell as her way to navigate the world, she has been enjoying learning about her new surroundings. She is house trained and gets along with other dogs. She hasn\u0027t been observed with cats, but it is thought that with her gentle and serene demeanor she will likely get along with them too. And she\u0027s also been observed in two households with young children and has done well with them. Possum really appreciates a soft bed and an equally soft touch. When she can smell your hand she will give you the sweetest and most appreciative kisses. This lady enjoys getting out and investigating in her new foster home as she will in yours. She is brave and gentle and has learned to navigate stairs. Though she isn\u0027t the most energetic of pooches, she is confident and once she knows she is safe and learns her new space, she is going to fill your life with love and will be a great addition to your family. She would be a great addition to a calm home and won\u0027t ask much of you but for your love and gentle caring."

He\u0027s already realized that there\u0027s some things to love in the world: Pets are good, playgroup can be fun, and splashing around in the drainage ditch. That\u0027s pretty awesome. Caden may be shy, but you can reach him, there\u0027s a fun-loving doggo inside just itching to come out. He just needs someone to show him how."

This cheerful pup loves playtime - swimming (his favorite!), fetch, walks, you name it! Diego will entertain himself indefinitely with a pool to splash around in. He is also eager to learn and is doing a great job with training. He already knows sit and shake, and his leash skills are coming along nicely. If you are looking for an active and lovable companion to join you on your adventures, Diego may be the dog for you. Come by APA! to meet this goofball today!"

    "description": "Sweet Franklin is a Michael Phelps wannabe! He adores swimming and is fearless in the water. He is also a member of our RuffTail Runners group, where he gets to join our volunteer runners for strolls on the Lady Bird trail. Looking for an all-around good hiking mate? Look no further! His paws were made for walkin\u0027, and he will be right by your side for new adventures for the small price of a bowl of iced water. Franklin has started to gather a following at the shelter. Recently, he was invited on a sleepover to a volunteer\u0027s home, where he was a gentleman; no begging for food, no getting on furniture and no potty accidents. He is very obedient and well-behaved and can sit on command, so we know he has some training in his past. Franklin seems like a dog who will bond closely with his family; he quietly allows pets and grooming of his gorgeous coat while probably thinking \"oh, I\u0027m so lucky to have you, please don\u0027t stop\". Come on down and check out this handsome ball of fluff. It\u0027ll be love at first sight."

    "description": "Karson won\u0027t only win you over with his good looks but also with his sweet, fun, and loving personality. He\u0027s great with other dogs and loves to play with them. Very submissive. He loves all people and will roll over for belly rubs. He\u0027s incredibly smart and has already learned sit and down. He just got his last set of shots so is working on his potty training and learning to use the pee pad when in the house. He listens when you say no if he gets a hold of something he shouldn\u0027t. He easily entertains himself if his foster doesn\u0027t want to play and will find a bone or toy to chew or just take a nap. He\u0027s crate trained and is really good being left alone. The only time he barks is to get his foster brothers attention for play but doesn\u0027t make a peep otherwise. Karson really is the perfect pup. He\u0027s learning to walk on a leash and so far is nailing it! He\u0027s just a happy go lucky pup that aims to please and would be the perfect addition to any family."

    "description": "Bambi is a cuddle bug who is so grateful to be with her new foster family after being chained up outside most of her life. She revels in the simple comforts of life - like a cozy bed of her own and toys she can play with quietly by herself. Bambi has quickly mastered new tasks like using a doggie door and walking on a leash. After some initial hesitancy, she has also embraced the relationship with her foster owner\u0027s family dog. The two like to romp and play in the backyard while they watch squirrels and find news things to smell. (She is part hound, after all!) Her foster parents have never heard her bark and she has done a great job blending in seamlessly to new surroundings. In fact Bambi is so sweet, laid back and \u0027chill\u0027 that her foster parents have given her the nick-name of \u0027Chili-girl\u0027.

    "description": "Brad is an affectionate gentle little pup! This guy is truly the king of total joy and kindness, and he has thoroughly mastered the puppy head tilt when you ask him just about any question! I\u0027m not sure how it won\u0027t thoroughly melt your heart! This sweet pooch is very cautious, and extremely curious at every turn. For such a young pooch he\u0027s also very low key. He does adore his chew toys and ropes; he\u0027s a whiz at tug of war! His current foster also raves about his adorable playful hops he does when he\u0027s happy, and his hilarious tendency to run in circles and immediately lay down in his crate for a break. Once he\u0027s exerted his energy, he loves nothing more than to cuddle with his person and smother them with kisses! Brad loves sleeping in his person\u0027s bed with them, and is a huge fan of ear scratches! His ears are actually quite adorable, and one flops forwards, whereas the other falls back. This precious look really matches his goofy playful puppy personality! He truly is the epitome of a good boy! He is super smart, and a very speedy learner! This clever little guy does very well in his crate when he\u0027s left alone, and will either just play with his toys or happily nap. He is so close to conquering house training, and with a little patience, he\u0027ll be an expert. He is working hard to master his leash training as well, and has already learned several commands. Brad is such a sweet guy! He would love to join a home that has tons of love and patience to help him grow into the wonderful dog he is growing into! He really just deserves to feel the complete love he promises to give his family, and to feel safe and protected. Brad is so full of love and sweetness; you\u0027d really be lucky to have him in your home! Come meet Brad! He\u0027ll win you over with his disarming vulnerability and his precious puppy kisses!"

    "description": "Timberline has the most beautiful white coat, and a huge love for people. She adores life, and is full of joy and friendliness! She really is a wonderful companion! This queen of affection will truly approach any and every human she sees hoping to get pets and snuggles from them. She also has zero problem laying on someone\u0027s lap for attention, and she is fully convinced she is a large lap dog. This sociable lady loves other dogs, and is very friendly when she meets fellow canines on walks. She is house trained, does great on her leash, and doesn\u0027t require a crate as she\u0027s very well mannered. Her current foster says she sleeps in the living room at night and does wonderfully, never making a peep. Timberline is a bundle of playful energy when she wakes up from her beauty sleep. Every day, she seems to be thrilled that she\u0027s around to live each day to its fullest. She truly exudes a warmth and gratitude to her people, and it will melt your heart. Timberline would love to join a home that has other animals or kids in it. She is so affectionate and having animal sibling would really give her a wonderful place to exude that sweetness. Since she has such a lovely thick coat, she gets warm rather quickly. That in mind, she would love a large home where she\u0027s able to stay indoors mostly, or have a family that is happy to take her on short walks throughout the day. Mostly, Timberline just wants a home that will give her all the pets and cuddles that she deserves. Come meet Timberline! She\u0027ll show you why her snuggles are like no other!"

    "description": "Geneva is a gentle, mellow girl who wants to cuddle with her human friends. And then cuddle some more, preferably in their laps. If this sweet girl can\u0027t get in your lap, she\u0027ll settle for just hanging out next to you or cuddling at your feet. Give her some petting and belly rubs and she\u0027ll start snorting with happiness and excitement. She\u0027s not very athletic, but she also likes going for easy walks, and walks well on her leash. Geneva should do well in any kind of home, with a family with kids or seniors who want a gentle, affectionate, low-key dog. Come meet her and see if she\u0027s perfect for yours."

    "description": "Guinevere is a curious lady with the most beautiful intriguing eyes! She has really been put through the ringer lately. Not only was she rescued during Hurricane Harvey, but also she was very sick when she came to APA. This little rock star has bounced back beautifully, and can\u0027t wait to put those crummy memories behind her and start life with her forever family! This pooch really is the epitome of resilient! Guinevere is such a good girl! She does wonderfully in her crate, is house trained, and has fully mastered walking on her leash. She loves playing with other dogs, and is even good with cats! She has been through so much, and is a bit shy when she meets new people. It doesn\u0027t take this sweet girl long to warm up, and once you\u0027re buddies, it is one of the most rewarding feelings! She adores her humans and likes to press her nose on you to show you she\u0027s your biggest fan! Her current foster says when you walk in the room that Guinevere bursts with elation and it will truly put you on cloud 9! Guinevere has an adorably curious nature, and loves to sniff around the house and yard to find out all the fun secrets it holds. She really blossoms when she\u0027s around other social, playful dogs, and likes to take their direction on what\u0027s allowed in the house. She seems to find a comfort having dog siblings around, and would greatly benefit from a home that could provide one for her. Guinevere mostly wants a home where she is loved and feels safe. With a little patience, Guinevere will be the most wonderful companion! She can\u0027t wait to move forward in life with her family and grow with them everyday. She just wants to belong. Come meet Guinevere! Her sweetness will absolutely melt your heart!"

    "description": "Eyes are the window to the soul it\u0027s said...and that\u0027s sure the case with Pony Boy whose special friend at APA! thinks he has hands down the most beautiful and expressive eyes in the land. You\u0027ll need to meet him to see what you think, but we think you will agree. Pony Boy is house trained, crate trained, has lived with a cat where both pretty much ignored one another, and older kids are a-ok in his book! He prefers people to other dogs, but with a good personality match and some introduction he could likely live harmoniously with another dog. Pony Boy loves snuggling and when it comes time for that activity he morphs into a cat and will rub on you or put his head in your hand or on your leg to let you know it\u0027s time for a love fest. He is a medium to low activity dog so won\u0027t require tons of exercise. But he does love bouncing around with some toys. Pony Boy enjoys learning new things and is in the Total Obedience Program. The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modeled after the AKC\u0027s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Pony Boy has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help him learn the skills to become the best dog he/she can be! He is learning lots of skills and already knows sit, down and walks great on a leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers or other dogs and staying in a sit or down until told \"free,\" and coming when called. Once Pony Boy successfully completes all the skills on his training plan he will be considered TOP Dog Ready! Pony Boy is working hard to become a wonderful pet and as a part of APA\u0027s Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with Pony Boy after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA\u0027s CGC program, on which the TOP was based:https://vimeo.com/89434193"

Ian is a bouncy ball of fun and wiggles who can\u0027t choose between chasing toys and getting in your lap. If he could have his way, he\u0027d be able to give you kisses and chew on a tennis ball at the same time. He\u0027s a bouncy, healthy boy, but not hyper; he will be happy to play or just snuggle up. Ian is an intelligent boy who looks his people in the eye and seems to understand what they\u0027re saying. He is still discovering the ins and outs of the world, but he\u0027s ready to learn-especially if there\u0027s treats involved. Ian is as clever as he is cute! Ian is in APA\u0027s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) program and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week toward the goal of passing the American Kennel Club\u0027s CGC test! Ian has been working hard to be a dog you can take anywhere with pride. To pass the CGC test, a dog must demonstrate obedience and general reliability in real world situations. Dogs in APA\u0027s CGC program learn to sit and down, walk nicely on leash, sit calmly when approached by strangers or another dog, won\u0027t approach people or dogs without permission, greet people appropriately, stay in a sit or down until told \"free,\" and come when called. As part of APA\u0027s CGC program you can work with APA to continue to build a training relationship with Ian after adoption and get officially CGC certified for free! Check out a video about CGC: https://vimeo.com/89434193 This lovable dude is going to be someone\u0027s great companion; he\u0027s ready to please and picks up on all the cues he\u0027s given. Come meet him and see if he\u0027s your idea sidekick."

    "description": "Lil Abner is a real dog\u0027s dog. Lovable, sweet, smart, affectionate, and patient are just a few words thrown around when describing this sweet boy. Just a little affection and Lil Abner will return it in spades; give his chest a rub and he\u0027ll rest his paw on you to show just how much he cares. He\u0027s a patient guy and gets along well with other dogs. He\u0027s a great listener and loves to cuddle, which makes him an easy friend to have. He\u0027s even easy on the eyes with his pretty auburn coat and gorgeous green/gray eyes. Insider tip: Lil Abner loooooves coconut oil. Treat him to some, and he\u0027ll literally be eating out of your hands. Lil Abner would love a home with a doggy sibling or two. He loves getting his exercise in the morning, running around and playing in a big backyard. Once he gets his energy out, he\u0027s a very mellow dog indoors, and just wants to lay around and be cuddled or watch the birds from the window. He\u0027ll kindly let you know when he needs to go out, and knows sit, shake, and lie down. Lil Abner is true gentleman and a real catch!"

    "description": "Tyra is two-third\u0027s hippie chick. Around people, she is as chill as chill can be. She loves to be pet, and to be near you. She has no problem being picked up and handled, despite the fact her size makes that an awkward process. And when she is outside, she is at one with nature. The bees and flowers are her friends. She basks in the sunshine, rolls in the grass, and sniffs and explores with an air that is downright spiritual. Tyra is house trained in every sense of the word. She is completely calm and respectful in the house, doesn\u0027t chew what should not be chewed and even walks daintily. She is big, but walks like a ballerina. She adores being near you, but won\u0027t climb or jump inappropriately. And she is cool being crated, if that if your preference. She loves to play with toys and will often greet her foster parent with her favorite toy in her mouth ready to play. The best home for Tyra would be one with a fenced-in yard. She would be a great candidate for a doggie door. The rest is a breeze. She\u0027s just a huge sweetheart. Tyra also enjoys learning new things. She\u0027s even trained for the Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test and recently became CGC Ready, which means she successfully passed the American Kennel Club\u0027s CGC test with her volunteer trainer! Tyra has been working hard to be a dog you can take anywhere with pride. To pass the CGC test, a dog must demonstrate obedience and general reliability in real world situations. An APA CGC-ready dog knows sit and down, walks nicely on leash, will sit calmly when approached by strangers or another dog, won\u0027t approach people or dogs without permission, greets people appropriately, stays in a sit or down until told \"free,\" and comes when called. As part of APA!\u0027s CGC program you can work with APA to continue to build a training relationship with Tyra after adoption and get officially CGC certified for free! Check out a video about CGC: https://vimeo.com/89434193"

This well-behaved girl is the definition of \"good dog. Latoya is in foster care where she\u0027s already best buds with the family\u0027s slightly older puppy, playing chase and tug-o-war; and she\u0027s getting along beautifully with the three cats. And the family\u0027s 5-year-old boy thinks she\u0027s his girlfriend. When she\u0027s not playing, this sweet, affectionate girl loves to snuggle on the couch, getting petting from her grownup humans. Then she\u0027s happy to settle down to chew on her squeaky toy, looking like an adorable goofball. Latoya clearly wants to be a people pleaser, and she\u0027s making good progress on her house and leash training. She tolerates being home alone in hopes of getting lots of love when her people come back. This easygoing girl hopes for a home with dogs, cats and kids to play with and grownups who will share love and attention. Come meet this girl and see if she\u0027s perfect for your family."

She takes a little bit to warm up to new people, but she is an ABSOLUTE SUCKER for some good behind-the-ear scratches and gentle brushing. That\u0027s how we were able to gain her trust. Shadow is low energy, and just prefers a few short walks a day. She is an older dog, so she is dealing with the typical older-dog troubles. She\u0027s got aching joints and poor eyesight, but lots and lots of love to give. She is easy on leash, and generally very low-maintenance. She doesn\u0027t show much interest in toys or treats, but she does live up to her name, and always follows us around, curious about what we\u0027re up to. We have not seen Shadow with cats but we have pet rats, and she has been around them outside of their cage. She seems curious for a moment, but then doesn\u0027t pay them much attention afterwards. I can only imagine she would be totally fine in a home with cats.\""

    "description": "Say hello to Fiona, a promising young pup who is on her way to becoming a fun family do. Fiona is currently living in an APA foster home, where she is proving that she is ready to become a full-fledged family member! This youngster has a playful side that helps her burn off any extra energy. She is always up for a game of fetch, and she\u0027s got quite a few toys with which she can entertain herself. Mix in some playtime with walks, and she\u0027ll be ready to relax with you around the house. And she is one affectionate, cuddly dog when she\u0027s feeling mellow! Her foster reports that belly rubs and cuddling are her favorite things in the world, and she loves most everyone she meets. Fiona is also a quick learner. She has picked up basic commands one after another and would love to receive additional training. And if that\u0027s not enough, she\u0027s good in a crate and well-behaved around the home even when she spends some time alone! Fiona is growing out of puppyhood and is on the doorstep of become a fun adult. With some leadership and consistency from her new family, she\u0027ll turn into a great long-term companion! Her ideal family would have plenty of time to give her both exercise and affection. An enclosed yard at the house is a plus! Don\u0027t forget that when you adopt from APA!, you\u0027re helping two dogs - the one you\u0027re welcoming into your home, and the next dog who will be able to join our program."

    "description": "From Yara\u0027s foster: \"Yara is a Hurricane Harvey rescue from Pasadena, Texas with a loveable personality and a sweet disposition. About 45lbs, she\u0027s a petite pit with a big smile. She adores walks, romps and belly rubs. She\u0027s been learning to sit with a sweet side saddle style! 90% of the time she\u0027ll sit with praise, but she often can\u0027t resist and will lay down instead hoping you\u0027ll rub her belly. But she\u0027s very responsive to treat training and she\u0027s house-trained and very good on leash. Yara isn\u0027t a barker and we\u0027ve only heard her voice a few times in the past three weeks. She\u0027s been in a home since the hurricane with a Great Pyrenees with whom she gets along great. Neighborhood dogs get a friendly tail wag, and while she hasn\u0027t formally met any of them, I can\u0027t imagine she\u0027d have trouble. Neighborhood kids are the same, though usually those are middle schoolers and we haven\u0027t seen her with toddlers or babies yet. Yara loves her crate and is very well crate trained. She enjoys a solid night\u0027s sleep with a covered crate, and is patient on Saturday mornings when the family sleeps in.\""

    "description": "From Johnny Carson\u0027s foster: \"He is a precious dog overall. He does understand \"no,\" and does not try to jump on furniture. He takes treats beautifully (didn\u0027t try to take them from the other dogs, waited his turn, took it very gently, almost like he didn\u0027t even know what it was, ha). And he walks very well on a leash. He and my social dog seem to love each other. He has learned to stay away from my not-as-social older dog, but still tries to be friends with her every now and then. He is clearly social, and I see the corgi personality in him already. He has happily partaken in the typical race wars with the dog on the other side of the fence, following the lead of my dog. His leg doesn\u0027t prevent him from running, and his tail wags all the time.\""

    "description": "A few words to describe itty bitty Ellie: She is a 5-pound-nothing bundle of sweetness, precious, lovable, loving, frisky and playful, calm and mellow. She\u0027s having a fantastic time with her big foster bro, Mike (who is also a chi). So if you have a dog, she would be in heaven. She does not seem to be afraid of cats and approaches my neighbor\u0027s outdoor cat without hesitation--but she\u0027s very respectful. She loves, loves, loves bully sticks and small stuffed toys. Ellie will thrive in a loving home with a playful canine sibling, a cat, and humans who are very affectionate. Ellie wants all the hugs and cuddles she can get. Are you ready to love on itty bitty Ellie?"

    "description": "Edison didn\u0027t get the best start life as he was found as a stray. Despite being skeletal and covered in sores, he still had a tail wag to give to a good samaritan that got him help. Edison is a sweet young boy - quick with kisses and his ever-wagging tail. He is quickly gaining weight and his hair is coming back in. You can already see what a beauty he will be. He will make a great medium-sized loving companion. Edison is 100% house trained! From day one, he has never had an accident. He is also crate trained and retreats to his crate to sleep at night to to take little naps during the day. Regardless of being a young dog, he is not a chewer nor destructive. He rarely makes a sound unless he needs to go outside. Edison knows the sit and come command. He walks easily on a leash and has proven to be a terrific jogging companion, trotting steadily at his foster\u0027s side. And he\u0027s very friendly and eager to play with other dogs."

    "description": "You may think Earl\u0027s most outstanding feature is his ears - so long, so soft, so floppy, so much fun to pull. But this goofy boy is really a comedian who loves the chance to entertain his humans. In return, he just wants to be with them, sitting at their feet and getting petted. And getting his ears pulled and rubbed. This sweet, calm boy also gets along well with other dogs in his foster home and loves to play. He\u0027s feisty and active, trotting around and sniffing, and then happy to flop down and relax. He\u0027s house-trained and well behaved. Earl will be a lovable addition to any home, especially one with humans to love and a yard to sniff."

    "description": "If you\u0027re looking for a good buddy who wants to hang out and enjoy life with you, come meet Cuervo. He can lift your spirits, and you can brighten his day, too. This adorable boy, with his great smile, is a smartie who already answers to the Drop, Sit and Down commands. And he\u0027s ready to learn many new things, if he can just be beside his human friends. Cuervo enjoys learning new things and is in the Total Obedience Program. The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modelled after the AKC\u0027s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Cuervo has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help him learn the skills to become the best dog he can be! He is learning skills like sit and down, walking nicely on leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers or other dogs, staying in a sit or down until told \"free,\" and coming when called. Once Cuervo successfully completes all the skills on his/her training plan he will be considered TOP Dog Ready! Cuervo is working hard to become a wonderful pet and as a part of APA\u0027s Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with Cuervo after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA\u0027s CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https://vimeo.com/89434193 This bouncy, energetic boy should do well with well-matched dog companions, and with older kids. Come visit and see if he\u0027s the one to share all the ups and downs of life with. He\u0027ll want to be by your side from that day forward. Follow Cuervo on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/adopt_cuervo"

    "description": "Flower is everything her namesakes are known for: soft, vibrant and unique. This pretty girl became a momma dog at a very young age, and after caring for her one surviving puppy, she is now ready to live a life for the books. Wandering in the streets did nothing to Flower\u0027s spirit; she is a playful, naive and gentle big puppy that gets so happy when her foster mom gets home, her entire body wiggles in excitement. As a welcome treat, she will more than likely give you her belly for some rubs, while you tell her all about your day; her adoring hazel eyes can make anything better. Flower shares her foster home with two canine siblings of different sizes and she does very well with them. She has demonstrated to be very playful and patient in her play with her own little puppy and may benefit from canine friends that can teach her a trick or two on socializing - she is very interested in learning! She walks perfectly in tune with her foster while strutting around the neighborhood and is crate trained. Due to her gentle disposition, a nice feline roommate is a possibility. Flower spent most of her life waiting for the chance to bloom. Could you be the sunshine to help her grow?"
