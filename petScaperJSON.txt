    "description": "Warren Hood is better known as Fennec by his foster - like a Fennec Fox! This adorable dog with the magical ears has come a long way to get where he is today. Fennec is a lover of humans, cuddles, play time, and zoomies. He somehow manages to combine gorgeous athleticism with endearing awkwardness. He\u0027ll soar through the air in a game of chase but toss him a ball and he\u0027s like that infamous video of a retriever missing the treat catch in hilarious slow motion. Awkward catching skills or no, he\u0027s quite a smartypants who learns quickly and enjoys showing off his puzzle toy solving skills. Fennec is now putting those smarts to work as part of Dogs Out Loud, a training program to help shelter dogs meet their full potential. He is kicking some serious tushy on his training goals and building himself quite a fan club along the way. Fennec has been saved twice from shelter euthanasia, no easy feat for a sensitive bully breed boy. He\u0027s hoping his luck holds and takes him all the way home to stay this time! To learn more about Fennec or set up a time to meet him, email [email protected]!"

    "description": "Perla is the Audrey Hepburn of dogs - beautiful, graceful, poised, and full of class (also - she never takes a bad picture!). Upon meeting her, you can\u0027t help but stare at her beautiful, soulful eyes. Her adorable perky ears and infectious smile light up every room she walks into. Perla LOVES treats, maybe more than anything! She still waits patiently for them and takes them politely from your hand. She\u0027s a great candidate to learn a few cool tricks; she already knows \"sit, \"stay, \"come, and \"lay down. Perla enjoys the company of people and loves to curl up on the couch or at the foot of the bed and relax with you. Perla is housebroken, crate trained, and very well-behaved in a home environment. She likes squeaky toys, fetch, and scent games. She also loves to stare out the window and watch the world. Although she enjoys a quiet, relaxing time at home, Perla has also enjoyed many adventures with her previous foster home - kayaking, hiking, and exploring a small jungle (just like Audrey Hepburn!)."

    "description": "Mickey is a fabulous walker on his leash, eager for neighborhood walks. And he likes playing with soft toys and is fun to watch as he zooms around the play yard. He\u0027d love access to a little pool for some happy splashing. He is good at leaving cats alone, and even seems a little scared of them. Mickey will be a great addition to an adult-only home, where his people can take him for walks, chill on the couch with him and let him be their adorable watchdog. Mickey plays very well the dogs in his playgroup, if sometimes rowdy with smaller dogs. He just wants to be in charge of the group, so he\u0027s happiest when his playmates are on the submissive side, big or small. He currently lives with three larger dogs and enjoys thinking he is the boss of them. He\u0027s somewhat the opposite with humans. He\u0027s fearful with strangers and can be nippy with people he doesn\u0027t know and trust, especially children who approach his kennel. He prefers females over males, but can warm up to males. He needs to have a human who isn\u0027t afraid of him and understands how to handle his \"naughty\" behavior. But once he gets well acquainted and comfortable, he becomes his human friend\u0027s cuddle buddy, happy to hang out by his person\u0027s side, or even in her lap. He can be a loyal little guard dog, ready to alert his person to any evil that might be lurking. He is always alert, and may do best in a non-apartment home. Come meet this little guy today!"

    "description": "Do you feel like a little lonely, in need of a partner in crime? Ranger Rick is here to the rescue! Ranger Rick\u0027s calm, polite demeanor has made him a volunteer favorite. You will never meet a pup that takes treats this gently. He has a soft and soothing personality - the kind that makes coming home that much better. And have you seen his adorable under bite? Ranger Rick has lived in a home before so we already know he\u0027s kind of perfect. He is house-trained and can be left alone waiting for his next adventure with no problems. Some of his favorite things are stuffed toys, car rides, fetch and long strolls on grassy areas. He also has the seal of approval as a great houseguest from his volunteer friends that have opened their homes to provide sleepovers away from the shelter for this sweetie. Ranger Rick walks very well on leash and is polishing up his \u0027place\u0027 and \u0027come\u0027 commands. He\u0027s super smart and enjoys his training sessions as they keep his mind active. He is also a TOP Dog Trainee. The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modeled after the AKC\u0027s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Ranger Rick has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help him learn the skills to become the best dog he can be! He is learning skills like sit and down, walking nicely on leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers or other dogs, staying in a sit or down until told \"free,\" and coming when called. Once Ranger Rick successfully completes all the skills on his training plan he will be considered TOP Dog Ready! Ranger Rick is working hard to become a wonderful pet and as a part of APA\u0027s Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with Ranger Rick after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA\u0027s CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https://vimeo.com/89434193 If you are looking for the Sam to your Frodo, come visit Ranger Rick and lead him to a forever adventure... just hopefully not to Mordor."

    "description": "Shamrock is a toy lover. And if you wonder what his favorite toys are, it\u0027s your dirty socks and underwear! Shamrock is restarting his life. He was found downtown in a box and was practically skin and bones. Since he\u0027s been in foster care, he\u0027s gained weight and although he\u0027s a low-energy boy, he loves to play and even do zoomies around the house. Then he\u0027ll ask to come up on the couch for a snuggle. He really gets energetic when his foster mom comes home from work, wagging his entire body and giving little kisses. And he\u0027s especially happy if he sees a new toy to play tug-o-war with. Speaking of playing, he loves his female chihuahua housemate and tries to get her to play all the time. Shamrock is crate and house trained, and freely roams his apartment when his mom is away with no problems. He has been diagnosed with diabetes, which is managed with easy-to-give daily insulin shots that he takes like a trooper. He does enjoy car rides and looking out the window as the world goes by. A home with a small yard where Shamrock could snooze and sunbathe would be a bonus. But he\u0027ll welcome any home where he can get the love and care he wants and needs. Come meet this special boy!"

    "description": "Marilla is delightful in all the ways dogs can be - goofy, cuddly, and completely unaware of her size. Marilla loves two things more than anything else in this world - fetch and belly rubs. If she has a choice between a ball or a new friendly person to beg for bellyrubs, she will agonize over it for a few moments, then usually chooses the belly rubs. And if she can get some playtime in water, even better. She has been labeled the \"Mermaid of Lady Bird Lake\" as she can be spotted at this watering hole on a sunny day, swimming the day away. Marilla\u0027s default assumption when meeting new people is that they are new best friends. She cannot get close enough to people and will wind herself all around you trying to get as many body parts touching as possible. Marilla also enjoys learning new things and is in the Total Obedience Program (TOP), which is modeled after the AKC\u0027s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Marilla has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help her learn the skills to become the best dog she can be! She is learning skills like sit and down, walking nicely on leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers or other dogs, staying in a sit or down until told \"free,\" and coming when called. Once Marilla successfully completes all the skills on her training plan she will be considered TOP Dog Ready! Marilla is working hard to become a wonderful pet and as a part of APA\u0027s Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with Marilla after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA\u0027s CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https://vimeo.com/89434193"

    "description": "Sparky is a sparkler of a boy and, really, just a giant lovebug who\u0027s pretty sure he\u0027s a lapdog. This sweet boy\u0027s foster says he\u0027s one of \"the most cuddly dogs I\u0027ve ever been around.\" He loves to lay his head in his person\u0027s lap and let his head be stroked. Then he\u0027ll want to struggle on the bed or couch - but he\u0027s also willing to go off on his own. Sparky has occasional bursts of energy, but he is mostly a calm, well-mannered boy who walks well on his leash. He\u0027s crate trained, seems house trained and answers to the \"sit\" and \"come\" commands. And he\u0027s working on \"stay.\" When he\u0027s in a playful mood, Sparky loves to play with his squeaky toys and he\u0027s happy when his human throws the toy or plays tug-o-war. Sometimes he\u0027ll fetch the toy, but mostly he runs with it and throws it for himself. Sparky will be a wonderful addition to a home where he can be a companion for an owner who wants to give him love, snuggles and long walks with lots of time for sniffing. Come mee this boy!"

    "description": "Tyra is two-third\u0027s hippie chick. Around people, she is as chill as chill can be. She loves to be pet, and to be near you. She has no problem being picked up and handled, despite the fact her size makes that an awkward process. And when she is outside, she is at one with nature. The bees and flowers are her friends. She basks in the sunshine, rolls in the grass, and sniffs and explores with an air that is downright spiritual. Tyra is house trained in every sense of the word. She is completely calm and respectful in the house, doesn\u0027t chew what should not be chewed and even walks daintily. She is big, but walks like a ballerina. She adores being near you, but won\u0027t climb or jump inappropriately. And she is cool being crated, if that if your preference. She loves to play with toys and will often greet her foster parent with her favorite toy in her mouth ready to play. The best home for Tyra would be one with a fenced-in yard. She would be a great candidate for a doggie door. The rest is a breeze. She\u0027s just a huge sweetheart. Tyra also enjoys learning new things. She\u0027s even trained for the Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test and recently became CGC Ready, which means she successfully passed the American Kennel Club\u0027s CGC test with her volunteer trainer! Tyra has been working hard to be a dog you can take anywhere with pride. To pass the CGC test, a dog must demonstrate obedience and general reliability in real world situations. An APA CGC-ready dog knows sit and down, walks nicely on leash, will sit calmly when approached by strangers or another dog, won\u0027t approach people or dogs without permission, greets people appropriately, stays in a sit or down until told \"free,\" and comes when called. As part of APA!\u0027s CGC program you can work with APA to continue to build a training relationship with Tyra after adoption and get officially CGC certified for free!

    "description": "Chubbs is a dog who is in love with life. He adores chasing balls, exploring his world when out for a walk or run, and then settling down for all kinds of cuddling and love. He\u0027s not above telling you that you are not nearly finished with the belly rubs should you stop too soon! Chubbs is a people-pleasing ball full of love. He should take to training easily and is going to want to be an active participant in the life of his forever family. He has shown appropriate interest in other dogs he meets. He\u0027s a strong, athletic boy who would likely be a great running, hiking or walking buddy but will happily run off a lot of energy chasing those balls. He loves playing fetch and is quite talented at it. If you would like to play and cuddle to your heart\u0027s content with an appreciative, happy, goofy, adorable wonderful young dog who would like nothing more than to be yours forever, please come meet Chubbs real soon!"

Rufus is happy doing just about anything - whether that\u0027s zooming around the yard, chasing tennis balls, or lounging in mud puddles like the cutest little hippo you\u0027ve ever seen. Once he gets a few zoomies out of the way, he\u0027s ready to lounge around and watch a Netflix marathon. No matter what he\u0027s doing, though, he\u0027s doing it with a huge grin and a huge tongue hanging out! His big smile and his wiggly butt are hard to resist. APA!\u0027s favorite little hippo lives big and loves big. We can\u0027t wait for him to get into a home where his big love is reciprocated and where he gets all the snuggling he can handle.

    "description": "There\u0027s something about black dogs. Though they are beautiful, they tend to get overlooked in the shelter. But if you could take a moment and visit Loki, you\u0027ll see that he is a total love-bug. He has that look that says, \"Want to have some fun together?\" Once you get him leashed up and out the door, he is full of life! He can lope around the ball fields with a big, goofy grin! No matter what he\u0027s doing, he seems very proud of himself as he struts his stuff. His true joyful nature comes out when he\u0027s outside having fun. His other favorite hobby is loving up on his humans. He is a very affectionate cuddlebug. He loves being around his favorite people, giving them kisses, cuddling on their laps and spooning in bed with them. He brings toys to his human friends for playtime, plays tug-o-war, chases tennis balls, and then does zoomies in the yard. He\u0027s a smart, treat motivated boy who already answers to a host of hand signal commands - including \"sit,\" \"lay down\" and \"shake.\" And he\u0027s crate-trained and seems house trained and is great in the car. If you\u0027ve got treats, he\u0027s willing to learn new tricks. Loki is a loving, loyal boy will be eager to please an active family and who can give him the affection he wants and will return in abundance. If that\u0027s not incentive enough, his adoption fee is paid. Won\u0027t you come visit him today? Please check out his Instagram @adoptloki.apa to learn more about Loki!"

    "description": "Prieta is a sweet girl who has been known to joyfully break out into running the cutest zoomies (sometimes while carrying a rope toy!) Prieta enjoys walks, wading in the water, and just sitting next to you with her head in your lap and watching the world go by. If there are two laps in the vicinity, she\u0027s an equal opportunity snuggler and will walk back and forth between the two to lean in for pets. She also likes toys (rope toys are her current favorite) and is happy to entertain herself with them. Prieta is a smart girl and learns new skills quickly. So smart, in fact, that she figured out the optimal way to get treats - by sticking her head in your treat pouch instead of waiting on you to slowly dole them out one at a time. Such a problem solver! She loves people, and once she knows and trusts you, she will be your friend for life. Prieta hopes to find a home with a loving, active person who wants to take her for those walks and jogs, then will curl up with her on the couch. If that sounds like you, come meet this beautiful girl."

    "description": "In a word, Moose is magnificent! Just look at him and you\u0027ll see he\u0027s a sight to behold. This big lug of a dog has captured the hearts of many ladies here at the shelter. With his movie star good looks and strong, silent demeanor, it\u0027s easy to see how he became such a heartthrob! Good looks aside, Moose has so much to offer. Like James Dean, he\u0027s a bit stoic, but it won\u0027t take long for him to warm up and nuzzle you with that jowly face. He morphs into a puppy when he\u0027s chasing his toys or taking a dip in the pool. His two passions in life are fetch and swimming. So if you\u0027re looking for an athletic, fun-loving guy, Moose is it! If you\u0027re a lover of the great outdoors, Moose is your perfect fit. He is a great walking and running companion. He goes out with his Virtual Foster friend every night for evening walks around the ball field. He\u0027s a gentleman on the leash and is learning some new skills. He\u0027s eager to please and will work hard for treats! Also, we should note that he appears to be potty trained and could potentially live in a home with a well-matched pup. So what do you say? Why not stop by APA today and see for yourself how much our Magnificent Moose has to offer?"

    "description": "There\u0027s just something about Chewy! When this short little sausage roll struts by with his ears bouncing, tail wagging, hips swaying, and a tennis ball or his favorite Lamb Chop toy in his mouth, everyone he passes has to smile and maybe even laugh...it really is impossible not to. This \"Chewy Effect is also transmitted through a camera - don\u0027t believe us? We dare you to look at his pictures and video without smiling or feeling a warm, fuzzy feeling in your heart. Chewy is a delight and has quite the fan base at the shelter. His passion and skill for fetching are known far and wide - he dares you to tell him he\u0027s a senior pup! In between fetching sessions, he\u0027s been known to plop down on the floor and roll the ball back and forth to you with his nose. Not only is Chewy housebroken, a comedian, and a stellar athlete...he\u0027s also a scholar. Chewy enjoys learning new things and is in the Total Obedience Program. The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modelled after the AKC\u0027s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Chewy has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help him learn the skills to become the best dog he can be! Chewy is learning skills like sit and down, walking nicely on leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers or other dogs, staying in a sit or down until told \"free,\" and coming when called. Once Chewy successfully completes all the skills on his training plan he will be considered TOP Dog Ready! Chewy is working hard to become a wonderful pet and as a part of APA\u0027s Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with Chewy after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA\u0027s CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https://vimeo.com/89434193 Come play a round of fetch with Chewy, so you can witness the Chewy Effect and the joy it brings in person! You can also follow Chewy on Instagram (yeah, he\u0027s that cool...) https://www.instagram.com/adopt_chewy/"

Her favorite things to do are to play with her chew toys, snuggle in the bed with blankets, and receive loving pets. She used to be really timid, but know she has opened to people and likes to seek lots of affection! Hailey is awesome with other dogs. We don\u0027t know how she is with cats or kids, but her foster parent think she would be okay with them. Hailey is so well behaved that you don\u0027t have to crate her when she\u0027s home alone. She\u0027ll need to be taken out regularly for bathroom breaks as she is working on her potty training. Hailey should do well in most any type of home and would make an excellent office dog, too. She\u0027ll charm everyone with her tiny baby face and adorable sense of curiosity. Come and visit this sweet pup today!"

    "description": "Galaxy is APA\u0027s version of Princess Leia with eyes that sparkle brighter than stars in the sky when she sees the people she loves. This affectionate, sometimes goofy girl can be shy when first meeting new humans, but once she gets comfortably acquainted, she lights up and her personality shines. She loves, loves and loves her human friends and wants to cuddle with them, sneaking in kisses and curling up in their laps. Galaxy is happy to take walks and play with toys, then lay next to her people and ask for petting. And if it\u0027s been a while since you gave her a treat, she\u0027ll put her paw on your arm as a polite reminder. Galaxy has great leash skills and is crate and house trained. Quick to learn, Galaxy is in the Total Obedience Program. The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modeled after the AKC\u0027s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Galaxy has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help her learn the skills to become the best dog she can be! She is now TOP Dog Ready, which means she\u0027s already learned all the skills in her training plan, including sit and down, walking nicely on leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers, calmly walking past another dog, staying in a sit or down until told \"free,\" and coming when called. Galaxy has worked hard to become a wonderful pet and as a part of APA\u0027s Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with Galaxy after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA\u0027s CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https://vimeo.com/89434193 Come meet this girl with the cutest, most contagious smile and see if she can be part of your galaxy!"

It just means more time for cuddling! Kapoa loves playing fetch, enjoys his daily walks, and even waits at the door politely when it\u0027s time to go out. He already knows the \"sit\" command and is working on \"down\" and \"wait.\" And he\u0027s crate-trained - give him something to chew on and he is quiet and content. And he\u0027ll crack you up with his goofy sleeping positions. One of his best is on his back with his legs up in the air! Come meet this sweet boy today!"

    "description": "Whiskey has had a very eventful life. Rescued from an abusive situation as a puppy, and bounced around from shelter to shelter, he wants nothing more than to finally find his person. And when he does, he will provide them with boundless love, loyalty and affection. If you are looking for a ride or die kind of love, then you should consider Whiskey. Whiskey is house trained, and comfortable in a crate. Though he is not too keen on sharing his family with other dogs, outside of his home he loves to play. He can moderate his style appropriately, going from a ruff and tumble session with big dogs to a gentle nudge with smaller dogs. Though he loves a good romp, he is equally fond of naps and lounging on the couch. Really, being with his people is his favorite thing. He is up for anything, as long as you\u0027re there. You will have the ultimate protector in Whiskey, a dog who will guard against physical threats, and comfort you from the more existential ones. He\u0027s the type of dog who totally knows when you had a bad day, and will up his snuggle game accordingly. Whiskey is not for a casual dog owner. He is for someone who is looking for a soul mate. If you think you\u0027re in the market, you should come meet him."

    "description": "Fredrick has a sweet, bashful smile that sums up his entire being. He can act like a delicate wallflower when you first meet him, but once he is comfortable, he is all about being up in your personal space. He is a pro-level cuddler. Fredrick walks great on a leash. He has good manners and is very focused on his person. Which is fortunate, because taking walks is his favorite thing. He\u0027d rather do that than fetch or wrestle with other dogs. He would do best in a home with a yard, as he loves being outside. He\u0027d like to split his time equally between the grass and your lap, if he could. He learned sit, and has proven to be smart and eager to please. All you really need to fall in love with Fredrick is to look into his eyes. He just has the warmest, most soulful eyes. When he gives you a little hopeful tail wag, it\u0027ll be all over. If you\u0027re ready, come meet him!"

    "description": "Petunia is an easy going, playful love bug. Her current foster says her favorite thing to do is chase critters in the yard. She\u0027s always on a hunting excursion. She\u0027s also equally content to hang around close to her people and observe. Sweet Petunia loves to cuddle, and will gently ask for chin scratches, ear rubs, and belly pats. She does very well with other dogs, and seems to really like kids. She is an angel in her crate, walks wonderfully on her leash, and always comes when she\u0027s called. She doesn\u0027t bark much, and is an eager learner. She truly aims to please. Petunia does require a little TLC as she struggles with incontinence. She is on some prescription food that helps her out, and she\u0027s content to wear a diaper if that\u0027s a preference. It\u0027s pretty adorable too! There\u0027s nothing quite like the awesome greeting this girl will give her people when they get home! She\u0027s full of excitement! Her foster raves about her beautiful soulful eyes, and her cute \"1st position ballet dancer turned out legs. Petunia is such a wonderful companion, and is excited to find her forever family. She would love having other dog siblings, and would do well with kids in the home as well. She has so much love to give, and can\u0027t wait to have it so deservedly returned. Come meet this little lady! She\u0027ll win you over with her spunk!"

    "description": "Cane is a sugary-sweet boy and a gentle giant who\u0027s just lookin\u0027 for love. This dog-shaped marshmallow is a big softie with people. Do you want to cuddle, give belly rubs and get infinite kisses? Cane is your guy! He would love nothing more than to take naps at your feet, opening one eye from time to time to make sure you are doing well. Cane currently resides in a foster home, where he is adored. He is housetrained, and has been doing very well in his crate while waiting for his foster family to return home. One of his favorite activities is to take strolls around the neighborhood, and he reportedly has good leash manners. When at home, he enjoys chewing on a juicy bone while you watch your favorite Netflix show. Cane is ready to find a place he can call his own. Unconditional love, lots of tail wags when you\u0027re around and the joy of his company all come included with his adoption contract."

    "description": "We know, we know...Zoe is friggin\u0027 adorable. Yesssss, we also know she\u0027s tiny and scruffy and OMG you have to have her. We totally get all that. BUT.......... Here\u0027s the thing with Zoe, though: We don\u0027t think Zoe was born with all her marbles. Or, maybe she lost her marbles at a young age. What we\u0027re trying to say is that this adorable little fluffy-faced dog is, wellllll, let\u0027s just say she\u0027s \"unique\" in case she figures out how to read and gets her paws on this Bio (hey don\u0027t laugh, she\u0027s REALLY smart). Zoe has been happily ruling over, errr, we mean living in a Foster home since the beginning of the year. Based on what we\u0027ve learned about her, we do think the right home for this maniacal muppet exists. The rub, though, is that this home might very well not be you. Here\u0027s what we think purely the home dynamics need to look like: - Only one to two adults for the foreseeable future - No other pets for the foreseeable future - Friends, family, visitors that will actually LISTEN to you when you tell them how to act around your dog Don\u0027t get us wrong, Zoe has tons of positively delightful qualities. She is very energetic and loves to play, nails the whole \"going to the bathroom outside\" thing, is wicked smart (that might not actually ALWAYS be a positive, see above), and is super affectionate and snuggly. She also does this ridiculously cute dance where she stands up on two and waves her front arms together when she wants attention. We\u0027d post a video, but like, we don\u0027t really need MORE people clicking on her because of the whole \"looooook at how cute she is I just CAN\u0027T!\". I\u0027m sure by now you\u0027re wondering what exactly Zoe\u0027s deal is. It\u0027s complicated, OKAY. Rest assured, Zoe\u0027s foster Dad will give you all the nitty-gritty specifics if you are brave enough to write him. Still not sure if you\u0027re the right fit? Well you definitely need to be cool, calm, and collected around little dogs, even little dogs like Zoe that don\u0027t like sharing anything and are very particular about where and when you touch them. Sounds fun, right!? All kidding aside, Zoe is beloved by her foster parents, and for that really special someone that can learn (and be taught by us!) how to patiently overcome these obstacles and live with Zoe\u0027s challenges, she will truly be worth it."

    "description": "Like the dog detective, Scooby is the perfect sidekick. Smart, loyal and a skilled detective! Plus he\u0027s a little on the goofy side. He will look at you with his head tilt and adoring eyes. He moves through life like a happy, gangly pre-teen with some pretty hilarious and uncoordinated moments. Scooby has a zest for life that just makes you happy to be around him. Whether he\u0027s throwing a toy in the air, splashing around in a plastic pool, batting his eyelashes in an attempt to charm treats out of you, or falling off the couch while focusing too hard on the toy he\u0027s playing with, he lives his life to the fullest! He loves to run, play fetch, tug of war with his favorite rope toy and sit in the water. After playing hard, he will go right into the plastic pool or mud hole of your choosing. He loves to be outside in the warm sunshine and has a favorite big rock he likes to sit on. When he\u0027s not on the rock, he loves to snuggle and sit in your lap. He loves his people and will show his love with lots of kisses, lean in\u0027s and snuggles and will even sit on your lap if you let him! Scooby has spent some time in a home where he was potty and crate trained. He also seemed playful and easygoing around cats. Scooby has learned some basic commands and is a smart guy who seems eager to learn more...because he\u0027ll do anything for a treat! Scooby is also in the Total Obedience Program. The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modelled after the AKC\u0027s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Scooby has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help him learn the skills to become the best dog he can be! He is learning skills like sit and down, walking nicely on leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers or other dogs, staying in a sit or down until told \"free,\" and coming when called. Once Scooby successfully completes all the skills on his training plan he will be considered TOP Dog Ready! Scooby is working hard to become a wonderful pet and as a part of APA\u0027s Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with Scooby after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA\u0027s CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https://vimeo.com/89434193 Once you meet this flirtatious, charming and playful young guy, you will be saying Scooby Dooby Doo -- I love you!!"

    "description": "Do you like to hit the snooze button a few times in the morning? Oscar does too! This cutie is happy to cuddle in bed until the late morning. He will also politely lounge around the house once he does get up, maybe chewing on a nice bone or stuffed toy. Don\u0027t let his lazy, homebody attitude fool you though. He is more than happy to join his human for a nice long walk or jog. He also loves swimming and wading in any body of water he can find. At the shelter, Oscar spends his time playing fetch and and going for walks with his favorite volunteers. He has also had lots of behavior training and likes to show off his great leash manners. He spent some time in a foster home where he has proven his love for sleep and snuggling, and impressed his friends by being crate trained and house trained! Oscar bonds closely with his humans. He may be able to live with another well-matched pup, and he seems to prefer the company of lady dogs. His biggest dream is a yard with his very own kiddie pool! Oscar is affectionate, silly, smart and eager to please. He also happens to be extremely adorable. He cannot wait to be living it up with a family of his own, one that will be dedicated to help him keep perfecting his skills!"

    "description": "Paloma is a very sweet girl who has shown herself to be quite easy in a home. She\u0027s a quiet companion, content to nap, cuddle and enjoy belly rubs. Paloma loves attention and affection. She has a silly side too, and will showcase her signature play bow and occasionally break out into a case of the zoomies. Paloma is housebroken and doesn\u0027t need to be crated, although she is crate trained. She can be left alone for hours and won\u0027t even get on the furniture, if not invited. Her foster mom has reported her to be a perfect house guest. Paloma is such a gentle girl and loves to lean in for pets. She\u0027s got the softest fur, especially right under her chin! Paloma is happiest with her person. She especially loves her walks and being outdoors and will go at a slow and steady pace; she\u0027s excellent on a leash. Paloma has a cancerous lump on her leg. While it doesn\u0027t slow her down or impede her abilities at all, it has been deemed inoperable, though we are looking into other options. But she requires no medication and she has no special needs. And despite her condition, our girl still has spunk! Paloma deserves a wonderful home and hopes to find one where she will give and receive much love and affection. Follow Paloma\u0027s Instagram @Paloma_eats_her_vegetables"

    "description": "Hey! Human! Guess what?! I love you! You know how I show it? Jumping really high and swiping at your face with my tongue! That\u0027s cool, right? Well, I\u0027m also working on my manners, so I won\u0027t do that...unless you like it!! Trent is a rough and tumble boy who is learning about manners and how to find the right level of energy vs. relaxation. It really helps if someone can play fetch for a while or take him for a long hike, so his house manners can be impeccable. He also enjoys games that work his brain like a Kong Wobbler, so he was to work for his food. He might be a little too hyper for small children until he gets older, but he could do well with older kids who can remind him of boundaries. Trent knows that life isn\u0027t all about play and has been working hard in his learning too. He knows all the basics like walking calmly on leash, sit, down, stay and coming when called (at least when the leash is still attached). Once Trent has had a full day of fun and energy burning, there is nothing he likes more than curling up with his human for belly rubs and snuggles. His whole body melts against you and he sinks to floor to fully enjoy his lovin\u0027. He was cat tested within the shelter environment, with a cat safely enclosed in a large space and Trent on leash. He showed interest in the cat but softened and obeyed obedience commands; he never barked or pulled toward the cat. Based on the assessment, he has shown the possibility of living successfully with a cat with a firm training plan in place to fully integrate the animals over a long period of time. Trent is an exuberant boy who will be a great fit into any home looking for a playful, friendly and intelligent pup. Come visit and see if he\u0027s perfect for your family."

    "description": "Here at the shelter, Lamar is often known as \"The Donut. He\u0027s short, sweet and the color of powdered sugar-just like those delicious little mini-donut morsels. The only difference is this Donut can help you shed some extra weight out on the trail, where he loves to go for runs and nature strolls. Out on the trail, he has proved to be the perfect companion. Totally un-phased by dogs and things on wheels passing by, he\u0027ll stay right by your side and often look back at you with a smile that says, \"Isn\u0027t this great!?\" In the home, he turns into a total snuggle bug. When he rolls over for belly rubs, you know you\u0027ve got a best friend for life! He absolutely loves cuddling up on blankets and snoozing the day away. Give him a little rawhide and he\u0027s a happy little clam. He\u0027s also playing with his doggie friends every afternoon in play group. It\u0027s possible he could fit right into a home with a well-matched pup. On a recent sleepover, he proved to be a model houseguest. In fact, he was described as \"perfect in the home. He waits to be invited before jumping up on the furniture, politely asks to go outside for potty breaks, and is respectful of his surroundings. This little donut turns into a potato when he\u0027s on the couch. If you\u0027re in the mood for a movie marathon, he\u0027s happy to curl right up by your side for hours on end. If that\u0027s not reason enough for you to take him home, we should also mention that Lamar is super smart and is in the Total Obedience Program. The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modeled after the AKC\u0027s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Lamar has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help him learn the skills to become the best dog he can be! He is learning skills like sit and down, walking nicely on leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers or other dogs, staying in a sit or down until told \"free,\" and coming when called. Once Lamar successfully completes all the skills on his training plan he will be considered TOP Dog Ready! Lamar is working hard to become a wonderful pet and as a part of APA\u0027s Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with Lamar after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA\u0027s CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https://vimeo.com/89434193 Please consider indulging in this mini donut today! He\u0027s ready to start living the sweet life he so deserves!"

    "description": "Marlowe is an affectionate Chihuahua mix who wants to be near you. He\u0027ll enjoy being carried by you and sleeping curled up against your legs, then snuggling with his human and doggie friends. This lovebug is well-behaved. He does well by himself in his crate, and he also walks well on a leash. He loves riding in cars, especially if he\u0027s on his way to a walk around the shops. Marlowe is looking for an adopter who will take care of him in his twilight years. He does well with mild-mannered dogs and cats, and will probably do well with older, respectful kids. Come meet this sweet gentleman today!"

    "description": "Saying Timmy\u0027s past is an enigma may be an understatement, but we pretty much know where he wants his future to go: a home he can call his own. Timmy\u0027s tail is always wagging while he looks at his favorite volunteers, with so much hope and love. He has made strides in the trust department since he first came in to APA, and little by little he is allowing for his friends to lean in close to him and sneak in a pet or two. He is just an ol\u0027 fashioned gentleman that takes his time before heavy petting sessions and doggie kisses. We are certain he is holding back a total love bug! The way to Timmy\u0027s heart has been strolls in nature; he loves walks around the shelter\u0027s fields, stop around to smell the roses (or Texas weeds!) and enjoy the company of his walking buddies. He has been learning leash manners and politely ignores other pups he encounters while in his adventures. Timmy lived in a home before, so he\u0027s probably got the house routine down. He keeps his shelter quarters in a tidy condition, and we think this will transfer to his future family home.

Sam can take a few minutes to warm up to new faces. We know the feeling. But once he knows and trusts you, he truly is man\u0027s (or woman\u0027s) best friend. We\u0027re wondering how his tail is still attached, with all the wagging it does every time he spies his favorite volunteers. After he feels comfortable he loves to come up for some petting. Sam has a medium energy level. He definitely enjoys a good romp now and then, but he also likes to get in plenty of beauty sleep. We think Sam would do best in a home with adults or with older children. He\u0027ll definitely benefit from a family who can provide him with both mental and physical stimulation and ongoing training. He promises to make the learning fun for everyone! Sam is a good playmate for most dogs. If you\u0027ve already got a dog in your home, we\u0027d be happy to introduce them to make sure they would be compatible housemates. But Sam isn\u0027t just a good-time Charlie. He\u0027s shown himself to be a smart dog and knows all of his basic commands. Often he\u0027ll ask you for instructions by waving his paws at you. Sam is in the Total Obedience Program. The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modelled after the AKC\u0027s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test.

    "description": "In a word, quirky would be the best way to describe this little rascal. He\u0027s kind of like the Eddie Haskell of dogs. Always up to something and ready to get into some fun shenanigans with his best bud! He may be small in stature, but his personality is larger than life. This guy is a character, that\u0027s for sure! He may have a mischievous look in his eyes, but Spanky is really chill on the leash. While exploring the great outdoors, he likes to stay right by his human\u0027s side. He\u0027s very curious about his surroundings and is always ready for a fun adventure. Walking is a lot of fun, but what he most enjoys is lap time! This little dude wants to be in your lap more than anything. If you\u0027re looking for a dog that will shower you with affection, Spanky\u0027s your man. Once you pet his super soft brindle coat, you\u0027ll see that he is made for cuddling! When he\u0027s not canoodling with his humans, he\u0027s happy to entertain himself with toys. You should see him tossing toys up in the air and flopping around like a fish out of water. Graceful, he is not-but he owns his clumsiness like a boss! Like his alter ego, Eddie Haskell, Spanky is smart like a fox. He enjoys learning new things and recently passed the Total Obedience Program. The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modeled after the AKC\u0027s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test.

Check out a video on APA\u0027s CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https://vimeo.com/89434193 See more of this cutie on his own Storify page!: https://storify.com/SpookyGurl95/operationadoptspanky-at-austin-pets-alive"

We don\u0027t know the exact cause, but their symptoms are similar to children with cerebral palsy. Dyson occasionally needs help changing his positions, but Hoover can move around by rolling and flipping. They both do very well in a large padded playpen and hey have a walker with a sling so they can change positions and interact with some of the other foster dogs. They eat a gruel mixture. Dyson can eat on his own but Hoover needs to be syringe fed. Dyson is also on a muscle relaxant to reduce his spasticity, but none of this affects their sweet disposition. Both boys love meeting people, their little tails wag so fast and they give puppy nuzzles and kisses. Dyson and Hoover must be adopted together. They will fuss and complain if one pup is picked up and the other one is not. But not to worry, they are so adorable people will be fighting over who gets to hold them!

    "description": "Murphy is a true go-getter. He\u0027s very smart and very athletic. He\u0027s not just interviewing to be your dog; he\u0027s interviewing for a job. Whether patrolling your yard for varmints, keeping you safe out on the trails or learning to run obstacle courses, Murphy is happiest when he\u0027s got something to do. Murphy is house trained, knows sit, and walks well on a leash. He is very protective of his home and the people he loves, so he can be a bit aloof when meeting strangers. He wants to decide for himself if you are friend or foe. But once he decides you are a friend, he\u0027s ride or die. He\u0027s as loyal as they come. If you\u0027re interested in getting into some sporting dog competitions, or if you\u0027re a regular exerciser looking for a partner, or maybe have a large piece of property in need of protecting, Murphy would love to meet you. He\u0027s got a five-year plan, a can-do attitude, and he can start immediately."

    "description": "Tito is a very friendly little guy who gets along famously with his nine foster siblings. Nothing slows him down, he has as much energy as dogs half his age, if not more! He eats in his crate to keep him from getting extra grub from his paw-mates\u0027 food bowls. He also believes any and all treats were meant for his royal self, but he is getting better with his manners. His favorite thing - other than food - is his curling up in his bed and blanket, and he is OK with sharing it with his foster brother. Tito enjoys the comfort of sleeping in the same room as the humans. He seems to be new to playtime, but he has discovered a fun little game of chase with one of his foster siblings who will engage others to play with him. Tito has congestive heart failure, so he will require medication twice a day with meals along with frequent potty breaks. It\u0027s hard to believe he has any medical issues with his outgoing and lively personality. A home with access to a yard and another playful pup is all Tito needs to thrive. But don\u0027t take our word for it, go visit Tito in his foster home and fall in love with him today!"

    "description": "Benny may be a grownup, but he\u0027s just now learning some of the finer points of being a dog. For example, he\u0027s learning that when he touches his person\u0027s hand with his nose and gives eye contact, it gets him a treat! He does love those treats, so they\u0027re also helping him become a fast learner. He knows to stay right next to his person when on leash walks. Minding the \"sit command is next in his learning curve. Benny is a silly boy who likes those romps in the yard - and then he\u0027s a big fan of naps. Come take a romp with him and see if he\u0027s right for your home."

    "description": "Beau is a classically handsome hound dog. He loves to do rugged, handsome things like play fetch and pose for photographs. You might assume he is a Clint Eastwood-type, but he is really a goofball. Just watch him try to play fetch by himself, and you will realize there\u0027s not a whole lot of self-consciousness going on. Beau is house trained, crate trained, walks well on a leash and knows sit. He can be a bit awkward when meeting new people and animals, but he is super affectionate with the people he gets to know, and he has lived with other dogs before. Since he does have some hound in him, he tends to emote very dramatically. \"I have to use the potty\" comes out like an epic, mournful howl to the moon. Beau enjoys learning new things and is in the Total Obedience Program. The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modeled after the AKC\u0027s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Beau has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help him learn the skills to become the best dog he can be! He is learning skills like down, walking nicely on leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers or other dogs, staying in a sit or down until told \"free,\" as well as \u0027place\u0027 (running-to and staying-in a designated spot) and coming when called. Once Beau successfully completes all the skills on his training plan he will be considered TOP Dog Ready! Beau is working hard to become a wonderful pet and as a part of APA\u0027s Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with Beau after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA\u0027s CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https://vimeo.com/89434193 Beau has been bounced around a bit, but is very ready to settle into a forever home. He\u0027s a funny guy with a big personality, and even bigger potential. Come meet him!"

    "description": "This handsome, tall drink of water is Rio! His interests are fetch, swimming, fetch, treats, fetch, and gently leaning into your leg for pets. I should also mention that he loves playing fetch, and he\u0027s great about bringing the ball back to you and dropping it. If he thinks you don\u0027t see the ball on the ground, he\u0027ll politely pick it up and set it in your lap, so Rio manages to enjoy fetch with even the laziest of tennis ball throwers. True to his name, Rio also really LOVES being in the water! Whether you\u0027re hosing him off or letting him take a dip in a pool or creek, he\u0027ll take all the water he can find please. Rio may be a big guy, but he is very easy to walk on leash. He loves walking outside to gently take in all the sights and smells around him...always walking by your side at a nice pace. He\u0027s a smart guy who sits politely for treats and appears housebroken. Rio is just a quiet, content soul who enjoys being with his person. He\u0027s an easy friend who would love it if you threw him a tennis ball or took him to swim, but he\u0027d also like a nice quiet walk around the neighborhood. Come meet this handsome guy today!"

    "description": "We are looking for a family who owns about 10,000 tennis balls so that Ralph will feel right at home. OK, that\u0027s a bit of an exaggeration, but this happy dog\u0027s best friend is anyone who will play fetch with him - preferably with tennis balls. Ralph is a young adult who has previously lived in a home, so it should be fairly easy for him to make the transition to yours. He is an affectionate, friendly dog who loves being with people, especially adults and older kids. But his true love is chasing around the ol\u0027 tennis ball. Ralph would love nothing more than a family who could take him out for some fetch. Ralph is also good on leash and will make a walking or running partner. He has an above average energy level and would love to be with an active family so everyone can get their exercise! Ralph knows his basic commands and would enjoy learning more. In a home where he can receive attention and consistency, we think we would turn into a great long-term family companion. And remember that when you adopt, you\u0027ll also be helping another dog who can take Ralph\u0027s place in our program!"

    "description": "If you\u0027re looking for a dog to make you smile, you found her. From the tips of ears to the tip of her tail, Marmalade knows how to have fun. She\u0027s an expert with a tennis ball, whether it\u0027s fetching with her human or rolling it around for herself. Her favorite game is burying them in muddy puddles and kiddie pools. Bonus points for the squeaky kind! Marmalade is the kind of dog who could possibly live with another dog, but would also be happy as an only child. But as long as there are enough treats to go around, that\u0027s what really matters. Marmalade is a sweet girl who takes a little extra time to really trust new people, but your patience will pay off 10 times over. She will reward you with unbridled joy and the sweetest kisses. So if you want a wiggly butt to greet you at the end of the day, look no further!"

She loves snuggling, getting to play in the yard, or taking a leisurely walk around the neighborhood. Her energy level is perfect and matches her surroundings. If it\u0027s time to run, she\u0027s a great running buddy, but if it\u0027s time to stop and smell the roses, she\u0027s good with that too. If you act like it\u0027s time to play a game of chase, she\u0027ll zoomie around the room with you until it\u0027s time to relax on the couch. Sandy also LOVES to swim or splash around in the water, so if you enjoy the water - or enjoy watching a dog splash around with glee, then you need to meet Sandy. She has experience in a home, is housebroken, and has lived peacefully with cats! This beauty also has brains - she knows the sit, down, and shake commands. Come meet the beautiful and spunky Sandy today!"

Papaya is a fun, independent, active dog who will want to stay busy with her new family. She\u0027ll be a great exercise partner for everyone. She likes to stay on the go and will enjoy going for daily walks. She also loves to romp around the yard chasing tennis balls. Papaya is also a treat-motivated dog who learns quickly. She\u0027s currently approaching TOP dog status in APA\u0027s training program, and she\u0027d love some ongoing work with her new family! We\u0027ve also noticed that Papaya is not at all needy. Once she\u0027s burned a few calories she\u0027ll enjoy some affection and petting, but she definitely likes to get her exercise in first. We love her independent spirit and playful attitude! Papaya enjoys learning new things and is in the Total Obedience Program. The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modelled after the AKC\u0027s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Papaya has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help her learn the skills to become the best dog she can be! She is learning skills like sit and down, walking nicely on leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers or other dogs, staying in a sit or down until told \"free,\" and coming when called. Once Papaya successfully completes all the skills on her training plan she will be considered TOP Dog Ready! Papaya is working hard to become a wonderful pet and as a part of APA\u0027s Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with Papaya after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA\u0027s CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https://vimeo.com/89434193 For a family who is looking for an enthusiastic, athletic companion, Papaya could make a great addition to your home. And remember that when you adopt you\u0027ll also help us free up space so that another dog can join us at APA!"

But hey, does she really have to choose? This sweet girl is as happy as can be and has a contagious zest for life. She\u0027s lived with dogs of all sizes in the past, along with a cat and kids, and has been a playful girlfriend to all. Plus, she loves snuggling with her grownup humans, who reportedly love to pet her velvety-soft fur. Chickla is a smart girl who answers to \u0027sit\u0027 and walks very well on her leash. She\u0027s crate and house trained, and does fine when left to roam a house. Doesn\u0027t she sound like the whole package? If you think so, come scoop her up! One look at her smile, and you\u0027ll be hers forever."

    "description": "Ellie is an affectionate, outgoing people lover with a smile to die for! She and her sister came to APA pretty confused and timid, but it didn\u0027t take this little love bug long to open up and show the world just how friendly she is! Highly affectionate is an understatement with this sweet girl. She loves cuddling with her people, and getting pets. She\u0027s adorably happy and wiggly with joy, and is incredibly generous with her kisses. The APA volunteers rave about her vivacious happy tail wag that she\u0027ll get when she sees a friend approaching. It\u0027s absolutely precious! Ellie is very sweet-natured, and enjoys her canine play groups, and also likes kids. She knows to sit for treats, and is awesome on her easy walk harness. She is a big fan of going for walks and jogs, but is equally as thrilled to lounge with her people around the house. Ellie enjoys learning new things and is in the Total Obedience Program. The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modeled after the AKC\u0027s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Ellie as a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help her learn the skills to become the best dog she can be! She is learning skills like sit and down, walking nicely on leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers or other dogs, staying in a sit or down until told \"free,\" as well as \u0027place\u0027 (running-to and staying-in a designated spot) and coming when called. Once Ellie successfully completes all the skills on her training plan she will be considered TOP Dog Ready! Ellie is working hard to become a wonderful pet and as a part of APA\u0027s Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with Ellie after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA\u0027s CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https://vimeo.com/89434193 This charismatic lady would love a chance to win your heart. She would do wonderfully in a home with tons of love to shower her with. She\u0027s exploding with affection and wants nothing more than to show her family how much she loves and appreciates them. Come meet sweet Ellie; she\u0027ll make sure you\u0027re covered in kisses!"

While at play and at rest, Stella likes to stay close to her human friends for attention and reassurance, and she bonds quickly. Out of the house, she can be nervous around strangers, but she does well on a leash and is well behaved on trails. Stella is crate and house trained, sleeping all night in the crate. She is calm and quiet in the crate, and if the door is left open, she will enter it voluntarily to lay down, relax and play with her toys. She makes herself at home very quickly and seems confident and relaxed. She is an expert cuddler and is happy to \"Netflix and chill, snuggled up to her person for hours-as long as she gets a run in! This loyal, lovely lady will make a wonderful addition to an active home with an adopters who can give her the training and opportunity to really shine. Stella has so much love to share, and she can\u0027t wait to show you just how much!"

    "description": "Amma be lovin\u0027 this dog! Amma is a young adult with a fun but mature outlook on life. She\u0027s smart, friendly, and ready to find her home! Amma has previously lived with a family and knows her way around the house. She\u0027s a real people pleaser - she loves to learn, and thinks training is great fun. She knows quite a few commands already, and would love to continue training with her new family. We love Amma\u0027s affectionate, silly personality. She\u0027s very cuddly and loves to spend time with her favorite people. Amma has a medium energy level - she loves to burn off a few calories playing fetch or chase, but she enjoys down time as well. She would prefer a home with all adults or older kids. Don\u0027t forget that when you adopt from APA!, you\u0027re helping two dogs - the one you\u0027re welcoming into your home, and the one who will be able to join our program."

    "description": "We\u0027re not going to leave out the best part - we\u0027re here to mention the bisque! Bisque is a low-key, but fun young adult. Bisque has lost his sight, but isn\u0027t let blindness get in the way of enjoying life. He is a goofy, playful dog who loves being around people. He\u0027s been spending time in an APA! foster home, and has shown us that he will make a fun companion. Losing his eyesight must have sharpened Bisque\u0027s hearing. He loves to hear praise and his favorite people\u0027s voices, and he\u0027ll respond quickly. He\u0027s not a super-affectionate dog, but he does enjoy some occasional petting and head-scratching. Bisque will need a patient family who can help him get used to his new environment. It will take him a bit of time to adjust to his new surroundings and learn his way around. But once he does, he\u0027s got a low-stress, casual attitude towards life that lets him enjoy his daily routine. Bisque has a lower energy level, so he doesn\u0027t need a great deal of stimulation during the day. He enjoys some outside time so that he can sniff around and explore, but he doesn\u0027t need heavy-duty exercise. Bisque would probably best enjoy a quieter, low-energy home. Concerned about his blindness? Once he gets used to your home\u0027s layout his needs won\u0027t be much different than any other dog. Bisque would love to meet you and share his carefree approach to life! And remember that when you adopt, you\u0027ll also be helping another dog who can his place in our program."

    "description": "Frodo is a party animal. He loves to have a good time, all the time. He\u0027s also super smart and very sweet, so if you consider yourself more of an extrovert, you may have found an excellent wingman in Frodo. Frodo will play with you all day if you let him. He especially loves to play with lacrosse balls, and enjoys showing up the high school team by making an occasional interception. He also loves being loved on, and gives lots of love in return. The most adorable thing about him is his one eyebrow. He is a very expressive dog anyways. You won\u0027t ever struggle to know how Frodo is feeling, but his eyebrow puts him over the top. Frodo is house trained, walks pretty well on a leash, and is well-mannered when left alone in the house. He is very treat motivated, and will do just about anything for a snack. In fact, Frodo is in APA\u0027s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) program and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week toward the goal of passing the American Kennel Club\u0027s CGC test! Frodo has been working hard to be a dog you can take anywhere with pride. To pass the CGC test, a dog must demonstrate obedience and general reliability in real world situations. Dogs in APA\u0027s CGC program learn to sit and down, walk nicely on leash, sit calmly when approached by strangers or another dog, won\u0027t approach people or dogs without permission, greet people appropriately, stay in a sit or down until told and come when called. As part of APA\u0027s CGC program you can work with APA to continue to build a training relationship with Frodo after adoption and get officially CGC certified for free!

Though Ehito has a few miles on him, he has some pep in his step and enjoys some rounds of fetch or some sprints around the yard. Then, he\u0027s happy to lounge around, sunbathe, get treats. He is basically a pretty chill guy and getting affection is his favorite activity. He\u0027s happiest just being around his people while they go about their day. Just being around people and in a comfy spot seem to be enough for him to be a super happy guy! Ehito has some good volunteer friends that have hosted him in their homes, where he reportedly is the perfect houseguest. As a mature gentleman, he is housebroken and is able to enjoy time by himself while being respectful of his surroundings - no destruction here, guys! Ehito enjoys learning new things and is in the Total Obedience Program. The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modeled after the AKC\u0027s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Ehito has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help him learn the skills to become the best dog he can be! He is learning skills like sit and down, walking nicely on leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers or other dogs, staying in a sit or down until told \"free,\" and coming when called. Once Ehito successfully completes all the skills on his training plan, he will be considered TOP Dog Ready! Ehito is working hard to become a wonderful pet and as a part of APA\u0027s Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with Ehito after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA\u0027s CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https://vimeo.com/89434193 Ehito is a senior boy who\u0027s looking for a family who\u0027ll give him some moderate exercise and a comfy place to lay his head. That and affection and love is all he wants, and he\u0027s ready to return all that love. Come let him show off his training and you\u0027ll be ready to take him home."

    "description": "Chachis is a beautiful, gentle soul, that has endured quite a bit, and lived to tell her story. As a senior pup, she came to us blind, matted and scared. But dear Chachis: your life has just begun! Now in a foster home, Chachis is recovering from eye removal surgery. Yes, Chachis may no longer have her eyes, but she still has her spirit. Like the little survivor that she is, she has been \"mapping\" her foster home quite well after her surgery. She knows how many sniffs it takes to get to her food and water bowls, how many steps to the backyard door and the smells that will lead her to her comfy pillow beds. Oh, the lessons we could learn from dogs! Chachis lives on like nothing ever happened. Chachis enjoys the simple things in life, such as sunbathing out in the yard while listening to the birds chirp all around her and enjoying a tall glass of water on the rocks - heavy on the rocks, please! Cute fact: she loves those ice cubes! Who could blame her? As the mature, respectful lady that she is, Chachis is house trained. She lives with a cat fellow in her foster home, and could share her future home with a mellow dog sibling. She makes strides everyday in the trust department, allowing her foster mom to comb her lovely curls and do a little grooming here and there. Those kisses and tail wags don\u0027t lie - Chachis loves human touch - she just needed time...and treats. Chachis is looking for her very own retirement retreat, with flowers to sniff, a plushy place to lay her head and nice humans to be her eyes."

    "description": "Booth is a loving, goofy boy who would be the ideal companion for someone with a moderately active lifestyle. He loves to play and enjoys swimming and playing fetch, carrying around his stuffed animal wherever he goes. He is housebroken and crate-trained, and has received obedience training and knows several commands, including sit, stay, down, speak, and shake. While he is very athletic and loves to play, he also enjoys being a couch potato, requiring only a few head scratches as he watches a movie with you. Booth would do best in a low traffic home with a yard. Once he knows and trusts you, he will love you forever. Can you give this sweet boy a home where he can thrive?"

    "description": "We couldn\u0027t think of a more fitting name for Twister because once you meet him, you\u0027ll get caught up in a whirlwind of love! This sweet boy will happily sit quietly by your side and lend a listening ear. It\u0027s hard not to fall in love when you look into those soulful brown eyes that say, \"Come sit down with me and tell me all about your day.\" Want to play? Well, Twister is also a puppy at heart! His joy is contagious when he\u0027s chasing after balls or playing tug with his rope toy. Always up for fun and games, he will sweep you up into a spin of laughs for hours on end. Just as good as with play, Twister likes to work his brain. Like a cat, he\u0027s curious of his surroundings and loves to be in the middle of things. Pop the trunk and he\u0027ll jump right in with a look on his face that says, \"That\u0027s what you wanted me to do, right?\" He loves getting outside and inspecting every bush - and if there\u0027s a water source nearby, he\u0027ll dive right in! Twister enjoys learning new things and is in the Total Obedience Program. The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modeled after the AKC\u0027s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Twister as a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help him learn the skills to become the best dog she can be! Currently, he knows the commands \u0027sit\u0027, \u0027down\u0027, \u0027shake\u0027, \u0027come\u0027 and \u0027stay\u0027. Did I hear you say wow!? He is learning skills walking nicely on leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers or other dogs, staying in a sit or down until told \"free,\" as well as \u0027place\u0027 (running-to and staying-in a designated spot) and coming when called. Once Twister successfully completes all the skills on her training plan he will be considered TOP Dog Ready! Twister is working hard to become a wonderful pet and as a part of APA\u0027s Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with Twister after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA\u0027s CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https://vimeo.com/89434193 Twister invites you to come on down and fall for him at first sight!"

She\u0027s also a play group rock star who loves to play with other dogs. Olive is sweet and quiet in her kennel, even when the dogs around her are barking their heads off. Her kennel is always clean too, so she appears to be house trained and she quietly and patiently waits her turn to be walked. Once she gets to know you, she\u0027s a happy and loving girl without being pushy about it. Olive would love to have a person or family to play ball with her and show her what real love is. Being a black dog in a shelter means she gets overlooked in favor of the cute fluffy dogs; will you be the person who sees her for the hidden gem she really is?"

He plays fetch like a Boss(Man) and can chillax like no one\u0027s business. He has a great set of basic obedience skills -- knows sit and down, waits nicely at doors, won\u0027t pester you while you eat, and of course he\u0027s house-trained. Do you need a companion while you work? This Boss is your Man. His foster mom takes him to her office each day where he relaxes on his dog bed and doesn\u0027t seem to mind being doted on by the office staff. (It\u0027s a \"ruff life but somedog\u0027s gotta do it.) When he\u0027s not by your side, you can probably find him snuggled under a blanket. His foster mom says he loves being tucked in tight. Boss Man loves humans and quickly builds a loyal bond. He\u0027d love to have a quiet backyard where he can play with his human friends. Boss Man has had a few rough years resulting in some mild arthritis in his legs. While he loves a good game of fetch, he has some days where he just needs to lay low. We\u0027ll let you in on a little secret, Boss Man would really rather NOT be the Boss. He\u0027ll happily leave that job to you. (NOTE: Boss Man must be adopted out to a home with a backyard.)"

Booboo is working hard to become a wonderful pet and as a part of APA\u0027s Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with Booboo after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA\u0027s CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https://vimeo.com/89434193. Booboo is looking for a trusted companion who can give him a home with outdoor space to explore and can earn his trust, continuing his training. If that sounds like you, come take this boy for a walk!"

    "description": "Do you want a dog who could model on the side to help you earn extra income? Copper looks like he belongs in a catalog! Maybe sitting in a small boat on a beautiful lake at sunset with a few ducks nearby. He\u0027s a distinguished gentleman who\u0027s quiet and goes with the flow. He walks extremely well on leash and loves exploring his surroundings. When it\u0027s time to play, however, Copper becomes the life of the party. His sweet face lights up with a game of fetch! He\u0027ll prance and play-bow, inviting you to throw the ball. He loves to swim and glides around in the water, just smooth as silk. Copper also enjoys going on hikes and is good about keeping up with his person. At the shelter, Copper enjoys going to our daily playgroup and could potentially go home with a well-matched doggie sibling. He appears to be housebroken. He also does great in the car. Just sits quietly or takes a nap. When it\u0027s time to chill out, Copper will lean in to be petted. He doesn\u0027t seek a lot of attention but is happy when he gets it. He\u0027s the perfect combo of active and chill, all in one pup. Come on by to meet him!"

    "description": "Charlotte is a sweet sensitive soul who deserves so much love. Won\u0027t you come meet her and help her to be the wonderful companion she is meant to be? She has settled into the kennel routine and will make great eye contact with you, but she really wants to be in her forever home. Charlotte is a little reserved these days. She doesn\u0027t quite understand what she\u0027s doing in the shelter. But once you take her out of her kennel she loves to run and would make a great running buddy for a human running partner. She is sweet, very calm and also athletic. This sweet girl has been disappointed it seems, so she is initially a little bit shy with her emotions, but once she is comfy with you, she will gently lean in and let you know she is ready for some pets and some love. How long could it possibly take before she fully trusts and gives and receives love? Probably not long. Just don\u0027t let her cool calm attitude put you off, there is definitely a love filled girl who wants to be by your side and be your forever friend. This dear one would be most happy in a home where she will be with an active human or family who will make her a full member of the pack and include her in all possible daily activities. If that sounds like a great match with you, please come to APA! and ask for Charlotte."

He\u0027s a happy guy who is content to go with the flow; this translates to being really easy to walk on leash and well behaved if you\u0027re out on a patio or walking a trail. Duke has already lived in a home, so we know he\u0027s housebroken and crate trained. He knows the \u0027sit\u0027 and \u0027down\u0027 commands and seems to pick up on skills quickly. He loves treats, so he would make a great training candidate if you\u0027re looking to teach him new things. Duke has a great energy level - he enjoys playing and having fun, but he\u0027s relaxed and chill when it\u0027s not playtime. He will lean in gently and sneak you kisses as a thank you for being his friend too. Do you want a relaxed, fun, easy-to-walk, housebroken dog? Come meet the Duke of APA today!"

    "description": "If you are ready for a fabulous day then meet your new loyal buddy, Gisele! Gisele is equal parts active and loving. She would love to spend all day outside on a walk, followed by tug of war and fetch. She likes playing with plush toys, enjoys relaxing by snuggling up next to you so you can shower her with lots of attention and petting. She will settle down in her own space, but prefers being near you. Gisele is very alert and excitable. She will bark to let you know any time a person or animal (including squirrels) approaches your yard or door. She is successful with basic commands and is quick to recognize/respect routines. She is excellent with her crate and goes in easily with a small treat prompt. Gisele is an enthusiastic member of the family. She is smart, wants to please and has endless amount of energy and love to share. Within moments, Gisele will steal your heart with her beautiful face, curious looks, spirited personality and loving manner (after she greets you with a series of loud barks). If you have the time, energy and heart to commit to this sweet, playful dog then get ready for a truly fabulous new member of your family!"

    "description": "Kuma\u0027s dream is just like many of ours: to spend his retirement sitting on the front porch with someone he loves, perhaps in a rocking chair, just watching the world go by! Seriously, relaxing on the porch is one of his favorite things to do, along with going for rides, chewing on bones, exploring outside, and being near his human. Kuma is an affectionate fellow who loves spending time with his person and is friendly with other dogs. Kuma has a touch of arthritis, but it doesn\u0027t stop him one bit from enjoying life. You should hear his goofy howl of joy when he gets a new blanket to curl up on! Kuma is a seriously happy dog who lights up the room with his bright eyes and easygoing personality. If you\u0027re looking for a loyal, laid-back dog to be your companion, come meet Kuma. We bet he\u0027ll steal your heart in no time."

    "description": "Elvis will play his way into your heart. He loves squeaky toys, balls, and his favorite is tug of war! One may think that a senior dog would not be as energetic and eager to play, but Elvis has broken the mold. He is active and loves the outdoors, so Elvis enjoys taking walks with his owner and exploring. He loves to be with his people, yet Elvis can be independent. He is content playing with his toys alone and can be left by himself at home, but when his humans come home, Elvis is the perfect companion. This dog will follow you from room to room because he loves his humans and simply wants to be near them. As trust builds up, Elvis\u0027s sweet personality shines through and his loyal self is all yours! He is the perfect combination of loving, curious, smart, and playful. Elvis is the perfect dog for someone who wants a companion and enjoys having the best of both worlds: a mature dog, with the heart of a young pup."

    "description": "You won\u0027t get too much bucking from this Bronco! Bronco is a sweet young adult who should make a great long-term companion for a lucky family. Bronco has spent time living in a home before, so he knows his way around the house and should be able to make a quick transition to his new home. He walks well on a leash, knows his basic commands, and has shown no sign of being destructive when he spends some time alone in the house. He can be a bit shy when first meeting new people, but give Bronco a chance to warm up and his silly, affectionate personality will soon show itself. He loves nothing better than a good belly rub. He\u0027s also an expert at chasing a tennis ball. Returning the ball? Well he could use some work on that. But he\u0027ll have great fun trying to play keep away from his family! Bronco has lived with dogs and kids in the past, and wouldn\u0027t mind sharing a home with them again. But he seems to be a versatile dog who could succeed in a variety of home environments. Hopefully it will be yours! And don\u0027t forget that when you adopt from APA!, you\u0027re helping two dogs - the one you\u0027re welcoming into your home, and the one who will be able to join our program."

This boy doesn\u0027t let anything get him down, and if you\u0027re ever feeling down, he will definitely lift your spirits just by being around him. Spike loves when you\u0027re sitting in a chair, so he can back up into you for petting and scratching optimization. His fur is so soft that you won\u0027t mind. If you choose the floor, he\u0027ll wiggle all the way up to you to get closer. The best of all, though, is if you throw him a tennis ball or toy...you can just see his eyes light up with excitement. Spike has also never met a squeaky toy he didn\u0027t like. Spike is a smart guy who appears housebroken and already knows sit and down. He loves treats, so we think he would be a great student for anything else you want to teach him. I think most of all, though, he\u0027s just so fun to be around! He is guaranteed to make you smile and laugh with his goofy antics. Come meet Spike at APA today and let his contagious joie de vivre make your day brighter!"

    "description": "Davey is a bouncy boy who gives off great vibes that say he wants to play with his new human friends - especially if they\u0027ll throw those balls he wants to fetch! And if the tennis ball is replaced with a treat, he\u0027s even happier. This handsome, healthy dude has such a bright, sweet disposition and he\u0027s so much fun to be around that he\u0027s ready to liven up anyone\u0027s adventures. And he appears to be crate and house trained, so he\u0027ll be a wonderful couch companion, too. Davey enjoys learning new things. He is in APA\u0027s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) program and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week toward the goal of passing the American Kennel Club\u0027s CGC test! Davey has been working hard to be a dog you can take anywhere with pride. To pass the CGC test, a dog must demonstrate obedience and general reliability in real world situations. Dogs in APA\u0027s CGC program learn to sit and down, walk nicely on leash, sit calmly when approached by strangers or another dog, won\u0027t approach people or dogs without permission, greet people appropriately, stay in a sit or down until told \"free,\" and come when called. As part of APA\u0027s CGC program you can work with APA to continue to build a training relationship with Davey after adoption and get officially CGC certified for free! Check out a video about CGC: https://vimeo.com/89434193 Come meet this boy and see if he\u0027s perfect for your home."

    "description": "Here are some things that are awesome about Dennis. He is house trained, knows sit, and \"bring it here\" when playing fetch. He is also hilarious; he makes all kinds of funny noises and gestures, and looks like some kind of goofy bunny-velociraptor hybrid when he is chasing balls, which is often. He is good at entertaining himself. He is very loving and loyal. When he considers you his person, you will be everything to him; he loves to be near you and to get belly rubs. While Dennis would love to have space to stretch his legs in a yard, he also wouldn\u0027t mind living a homebody life in an apartment. He\u0027s got a decent amount of energy for a mature, 8 year old gentleman. Dennis is looking for a best friend that shows him the world and helps him see the good in humans. In return, this handsome devil will give you all the love you can handle."

    "description": "Her name is Lola, she is a showgirl... Lovely Lola loves to play. A lot. You can see the excitement in her eyes when she knows you\u0027re about to have a good romp or game of tug-of-war. She\u0027s a clever one who enjoys learning new skills; in her short time with us, she\u0027s already mastered running on the treadmill and \u0027sit\u0027, Like the star she is, after a job well done, she will look to you for applause on a job well done. Beyond the fun and games, YOU might just become Lola\u0027s favorite thing. She is super affectionate towards the special people in her life; she loves giving kisses to those closest to her, and you\u0027ll no doubt witness her pure joy when her adorable smooshy face greets you. P.S. That smooshy face also means she sometimes snorts while running zoomies in the backyard; it\u0027s adorable, trust us. Lola may be able to do the cha-cha with a doggie sibling at her forever home. We\u0027d be happy to facilitate a meet and greet to see how they get along! Would you like to make your home Lola\u0027s own Copacabana?"

    "description": "Are you ready for some fun? Well come on over and meet Tugg! This playful little spitfire is always ready for a game of fetch, a dip in the lake or a ride in the car. Take him out for a visit and you\u0027ll see that Tugg is the whole package-highly skilled, a good boy in the home, and super athletic! Here at the shelter, Tugg has become quite popular with the volunteers. His friends often remark on how well-mannered he is on the leash. In fact, he has become the go-to dog for behavioral training sessions. Always eager to please, he is happy to show off his many skills. His sleepover friend reported that he\u0027s the perfect gentleman in the home. He waits to be invited on the bed and will only chew and tug on his toys. He also shows great potential in being crate trained. Tugg has so many great qualities, but anyone who knows him will tell you that he is the shelter\u0027s most talented fetch player! It\u0027s hard not to laugh when he breaks out into full-body wiggles at the sight of a tennis ball. His happiness is contagious when he\u0027s playing his favorite sport. And when playtime is over, he\u0027s ready for a long snuggle session on the couch. If that\u0027s not reason enough to take him home, look at that sweet baby seal face! He has a way of tugging people toward him with those soulful eyes. Don\u0027t resist the tug and visit with him today!"

    "description": "Meet Faraon; this honorable gentleman is loyal, loving, curious, and very attentive! Much like a Boy Scout, our Faraon enjoys being apart of a family-pack while going on adventures. Exploring with him is easy; he\u0027s great on a leash, responds when called, and enjoys carrying supplies for the team (e.g water, snacks, etc.). The foster family living with Faraon speaks highly of him; his intelligence, eagerness to please, and sweet-tooth have made him easy to train. Not only does Faraon know basic commands such as \"Sit, \"Down, \"Stay, \"Relax; but also \"Home, \"Heel, \"Spin, and \"Touch! This boy\u0027s insatiable appetite for learning makes training easy \u0026 enjoyable for everyone involved. After a day of moderate physical and/or mental exercise, Faraon likes to relax within the home - often you will find him on the carpet or in his crate, but never on furniture. His respect for household objects would make anyone proud - this dog hasn\u0027t shown any destructive tendencies and is fully house-broken. Faraon is a model pup that would love nothing more than to be your one and only. Would you give him a chance?"

His smirky smile will melt your heart, watch out Princess Leia the line is long for this guy! This guy is so cool to hang out with and a Millennium Falcon is not required! This gentle giant has has a few years on him and his back legs are a little wobbly, but after years of dealing with Storm Troopers its to be expected. He has enjoyed some water therapy in Lady Bird Lake and would really appreciate the opportunity to continue adventures either at the lake or possibly a pool with supervision. He can be easily entertained by most fluffy objects and probably would enjoy a new light saber as what would he be without one? Hans Solo will be a loyal friend by your side and may the force be with you! Inquire about him as he\u0027s out of this world!"

    "description": "May\u0027s signature wiggling walk and big smile will make you squeal with glee! She just spreads joy wherever she goes. It\u0027s hard to choose a word other than \"perfect to describe this girl who is equal parts spunky and sweet! May is quite the athlete and loves fetching and water - and especially loves when these two are combined. She\u0027s been known to stick her whole head underwater to retrieve a ball. As much fun as she is to play with, she is also very well-behaved in a home. She is housebroken, calm, and respectful of human items and food. She is content to snuggle with you or lay by your feet as you watch TV. May knows \u0027sit\u0027 and walks well on leash. She would make a great hiking partner. She also seems to learn quickly and loves food, so we think she would make a great training student. Aside from her skills, she\u0027s just a doll and a delight to be around. She has the biggest, brightest smile and is so much fun! Come visit her at APA today."

    "description": "Clark is a sweet and mellow gentleman. He loves his human friends and is eager to please. He has a cute way to communicate \"I love you with wiggles and sounds when his friends walk by. Clark plays it cool and isn\u0027t a needy guy at all. He\u0027s house trained and can just chill by himself, looking out the window or hanging out on the patio, or he can spend a whole day cuddling next to you on the couch. But don\u0027t let his quiet demeanor deceive you. Clark is also up for an adventure! He\u0027s on the Rufftail Running team and is happy for long walks or jogs - whatever his human is into! He is very easy to handle on a leash, knows his commands and stays in touch through eye contact. The ideal family for Clark will make sure to keep him somewhat active, but more importantly will make time to spend with him around the house. He loves to be in your lap on your couch, but is smart enough to realize that he needs to get your permission first. He loves people so much, and may be able to share a home with a well-matched doggie sibling. We call him McDreamy because he looks deep into your eyes and you want to tell him your secrets. Whether you live in an apartment or house, Clark will be your faithful sidekick at home or around town, from the moment you give him the opportunity of a forever home. Follow Clark on Instagram @clark.the.lapdog https://www.instagram.com/clark.the.lapdog/?hl\u003den"

    "description": "Gracie is an Austinite through and through. She loves staying active in any way possible: walking the neighborhood, jogging by your bike, swimming in the lake, or hiking the trails. She\u0027s also a fetch master and tug enthusiast. Between her leash skills and love of people, she makes a great companion for food truck dining and coffee shop patios. After a run or a swim or a game of fetch, she\u0027s more than happy to snuggle up with you and shower you with kisses. This intelligent, affectionate pup is always eager to learn new tricks (especially if there are treats in it for her) and is in the Total Obedience Program. The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modelled after the AKC\u0027s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Gracie has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help her learn the skills to become the best dog she can be! She is learning skills like sit and down, walking nicely on leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers or other dogs, staying in a sit or down until told \"free,\" and coming when called. Once Gracie successfully completes all the skills on his/her training plan he/she will be considered TOP Dog Ready! Gracie is working hard to become a wonderful pet and as a part of APA\u0027s Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with Gracie after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA\u0027s CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https://vimeo.com/89434193"

Dakota is thought to be a lab mix, but we think she\u0027s the perfect size for any home. She is house trained, and by that we mean not just potty trained, but also polite; she never messes with anything that isn\u0027t hers. She\u0027ll move into a new home with little stress due to her great manners and mellow disposition. Dakota enjoys walks and does well on her leash though she is curious about the world. She is terrific in her crate and even knows some commands such as \u0027sit\u0027 and \u0027shake\u0027. She is an affectionate gal who will be generous in allowing you to satisfy your desire to give belly rubs all the live long day if you like! Come meet Dakota...she\u0027s waiting for you!!"

He enjoys napping and having his back massaged. This gentleman is well-behaved. He lived in a home for several years, and was returned through no fault of his own. He is house trained and was reported to have great manners in the home. He\u0027s a star RuffTail trail dog, which means he\u0027s excellent on leash on the trail and a great companion for walks around the lake! Nelson is seeking a second chance at a home with a comfy bed and an adopter who will take him on daily walks and stick with him through thick and thin. Would you be his best friend forever?"

    "description": "Scotty lost his home because his previous owner passed away, but he has quickly adapted to his new life in a foster home. Scotty gets along easily and comfortably with the other dogs in the household, even though they weigh between 38 and 44 pounds to his 11 lbs of awesome. He is happy to follow them outside to lay in the sun and do their business. He\u0027s not at all destructive, gets along well with everybody, and has a excellent appetite--whether canned food, dry food, or snacks. This sweet senior deserves a loving home where he can spend his golden years, especially with someone with lots of love and time to pet, cuddle and coddle, but anyone with a heart for older dogs would love him too. Could it be you?"

    "description": "Farley is a big boy with a big heart, and he\u0027s looking for a home where he can receive some big love! His volunteer friends say this gentle boy is a truly magical dog - a total cuddlebug who loves his people. He\u0027ll take treats gently from your hand in hopes that your hand will then pet him all over. Farley\u0027s a smart boy and is learning new skills every day. He answers to \u0027sit,\u0027 \u0027down,\u0027 \u0027come\u0027 and walks well on his leash, lighting up when he sees he\u0027s about to go for a walk. He loves to explore outside and really enjoys spending time in the water. Farley asks for very little - a chew toy or stuffed king will make him your best friend forever, happy to lay down at your feet while you\u0027re having dinner or watching TV or just chill and listen to music. Farley is looking for a home where he can give his unconditional love to adults and older kids. Come meet this playful boy today!"

    "description": "Lil Abner is a real dog\u0027s dog. Lovable, sweet, smart, affectionate, and patient are just a few words thrown around when describing this sweet boy. Just a little affection and Lil Abner will return it in spades; give his chest a rub and he\u0027ll rest his paw on you to show just how much he cares. He\u0027s a patient guy and gets along well with other dogs. He\u0027s a great listener and loves to cuddle, which makes him an easy friend to have. He\u0027s even easy on the eyes with his pretty auburn coat and gorgeous green/gray eyes. Insider tip: Lil Abner loooooves coconut oil. Treat him to some, and he\u0027ll literally be eating out of your hands. Lil Abner would love a home with a doggy sibling or two. He loves getting his exercise in the morning, running around and playing in a big backyard. Once he gets his energy out, he\u0027s a very mellow dog indoors, and just wants to lay around and be cuddled or watch the birds from the window. He\u0027ll kindly let you know when he needs to go out, and knows sit, shake, and lie down. Lil Abner is true gentleman and a real catch!"

    "description": "Minka embodies everything that is good and pure about a dog. In a word, she is resilient. The wounds from her rough past are visible on her skin, but her effervescent spirit shines through when she flashes that gorgeous smile and breaks out into full-body wiggles. This sweet girl has never met a stranger. Everyone who walks by her kennel door is a potential new best friend. Stop and give her a pet and she\u0027ll reward you with kisses and cuddles. It\u0027s always amusing when she flops over for belly rubs and wiggles around with her stubby legs up in the air. She may be missing an ear, but that won\u0027t stop her from living life to its fullest. She loves getting out and sniffing new scents. She\u0027s great on the leash and is more than happy to join you on a leisurely stroll. Her favorite activity, however, is snuggling. Nothing makes her happier than canoodling with her human friends on the couch, snorting and snuffling in delight! Minka has so much potential to make her forever family very happy for many years to come. So what do you say? Are you ready to give Minka the loving home she so deserves? Please consider meeting her today!"

    "description": "Julio is a puppy in an adult dog\u0027s body, in the best of the ways. He looks and acts like that goofy, lanky teenager we all know and love. Julio is always up for a party, and he lives life to the fullest, whether that\u0027s romping around the yard, chasing a toy, or tricking you into giving him all your treats. Julio is all about those treats! He knows sit, down, shake (he\u0027s ambidextrous!), stay, and come. He will do anything for food, so there\u0027s probably no end to what you could teach him! Julio is also already housebroken. He would probably enjoy an active home where playing and fun are the name of the game. Julio is just one of the happiest dogs you\u0027ll meet; he has this big, goofy grin that seems to say, \"Hey guys! What are we doing next?! His zest for life is absolutely contagious. And have you seen the guy? He is so handsome! However, he doesn\u0027t let his looks get to his head, and will greet you with his tongue hanging out of that big, adorable, goofy grin. Come meet our favorite good lookin, goofball today."

    "description": "Thor is your guy if you enjoy the one to one of having an \"only\" dog. He is a dog whose supreme wish is a home of his own without other doggie siblings. He hasn\u0027t been observed with cats or children. Thor is said to be eager and silly. He\u0027s eager to learn, that\u0027s for sure. He\u0027s a dream on a leash and loves jaunting around the ball fields. If you want a goofy snuggler, Thor is going to fill that bill. When you meet him at the shelter he will seem on high alert, but once away from the shelter environment, snuggler deluxe and best friend are his MO. And he loves his treats, so is quite motivated for lessons and to learn. Thor seems to listen totally, with his ears showing he is paying attention. They will move to the top of his head when he\u0027s listening, and the tiniest flop over of the ears lets you know he\u0027s paying full attention. Isn\u0027t that cute? Thor would love to be your only four-legged friend, so please come meet him and give him the home in which he will thrive for all time. And remember, all APA adoptions come with free behavior assistance through APA\u0027s behavior team. In addition to all of Thor\u0027s wonderful natural qualities, he has been working hard to be a dog you can take anywhere with pride. Thor has been working on his Canine Good Citizen skills with APA staff and volunteers. To pass the American Kennel Club\u0027s CGC test (and be considered CGC-ready by APA), a dog must demonstrate obedience and general reliability in real world situations. An APA CGC-ready dog knows sit and down, walks nicely on leash, will sit calmly when you are approached by strangers or another dog, won\u0027t approach people or dogs without permission, stays in sit or down until told \"free,\" and comes when called. This training is very connected to your dog\u0027s relationship with you, so regardless of where Thor is in this training program at the time of adoption, APA will work with you to help you establish this relationship and keep the training going. Check out a video about CGC: http://player.vimeo.com/video/89434193"

    "description": "Hello! Do you want cute, spritely and smart as a whip when you adopt a dog? Then you came to the right place! Farrah is a bundle of fun, rolled up in a treat-motivated body that is always ready for the next adventure. This young boxer mix weighs all of 40 pounds, so she\u0027s a perfect size for just about any household. Farrah thinks learning new tricks is the absolute bee\u0027s knees. She\u0027s got an A+ sit and a solid B in leash walking. She is one of our TOP (Total Obedience Program) dogs, so she\u0027s also working on skills like coming when called, down and place. Though some might think that a 40-pound dog might not fit on their lap, Farrah is here to tell you different. She finds just the right amount of curled up and sprawled out to make sure your lap is never cold. She has a heart murmur, but it doesn\u0027t slow her down. Her spunky little attitude will always cheer you up. And kisses are absolutely included. The shelter is a pretty chaotic place for Farrah, so don\u0027t judge dogs by their kennel behavior. Farrah is home ready and knows the fine art of sleeping on soft beds and being a lovely companion."

Today Beryl is delighted to be learning what\u0027s it\u0027s like to be taken on walks, what playing fetch means and what toys are for. And most of all, he loves cuddling and belly rubs! He wants to follow his new human friends everywhere, sitting quietly at their feet getting head rubs, and then flipping over for those belly scratches.

    "description": "Ellie May is such a sweet old gal! She was found as a stray, emaciated and with a lot of hair loss. She is recovering from all of that and is putting on a lot of weight and her fur is growing back. Ellie May loves to eat and loves bath time with oatmeal shampoo and coconut oil. She is calm, quiet and completely house trained. She loves all other dogs, cats (and will even put up with her naughty foster puppy brother... always motherly and gentle). But she loves attention more than anything else and she will take it from anyone. She will just put her head right on your lap to know you\u0027re nearby. She deserves to be pampered and loved like the sweet-hearted and beautiful elderly gal she is!"

    "description": "Robert is a super smart dog. He\u0027s experiences the world differently because he\u0027s deaf, but that doesn\u0027t stop him from enjoying all that his hoomans can offer him, especially treats, belly rubs, and more treats. Did we mention treats? Robert is keen to learn new hand commands especially if food is involved. We think Robert used to be a gambler in a former life because he wants you to show him your hands to prove that you don\u0027t have any more food for him. Afterwards, he\u0027ll settle down for some belly rubs and if you happen to find more treats...super! He\u0027ll happily take then off your hands. Robert knows the hand signals for sit, down, and come. He is a fast learner and he is working on place and stay. In addition to being super smart, he is a dream on the leash when he goes for a walk. He likes to stop and smell the flowers and he happily walks beside you. He also has unique eyes, one blue and one brown. This is great for all those fashionistas out there who want to color coordinate his outfits. Our behavior staff will gladly teach you Robert\u0027s hand signals so you can continue his training. Come meet this handsome boy today!"

He loves to play games as part of his training, and he catches on pretty quick. He loves to run, is very affectionate, and a natural snuggler. Not to mention handsome as all get-out! He is a parvo survivor and a strong little guy. He is comfortable with humans and other dogs, and would probably benefit for doggy playdates to help with socialization. Overall he is an energetic little bundle with lots of love to give. Won\u0027t you make Aramis part of your family?"

    "description": "This Coco Chanel hasn\u0027t invented any perfume to give you yet, but until she does she\u0027ll give you many, many kisses instead. Coco fills up with love for her new friends after a little warming up time. She will follow her people from room to room and gently offers kissing their noses, faces, fingers, wherever she can reach. And she hopes for lots of petting in return. This smart, playful girl is in foster care where she also loves playing with her dog housemates. And she enjoys picking up toys, although isn\u0027t quite sure yet what to do with them. So she\u0027ll accept a treat and chew on her antler bone. Coco is crate and house trained, and she\u0027s making progress on her leash walking, showing signs of becoming a good running buddy. A gentle, mellow girl, Coco would be happy to live with other dogs, or just an content to be the only dog in a home. Plus, she should do well with gentle kids. Come meet this very sweet lady!"

    "description": "Angel Jack would settle for being a Happy Jack, and he\u0027s looking for a home where he could settle in. This compact-sized bundle of joy is sweet and friendly. He has lived in a home before, so we anticipate he will be well mannered and respectful - a great snuggling partner. He has a moderate energy level - he likes exercise but also needs plenty of beauty rest. At the shelter, his friends love his happy disposition - he loves to give affection to anyone he trusts. He loves to walk on a leash and will make a great exercise partner. Angel\u0027s beefy physique is no mistake - he is a treat-motivated, trainable dog. Got a snack for him? He\u0027s all yours! Angel Jack will repay your love and devotion with years of wonderful companionship. And don\u0027t forget that when you adopt from APA!, you\u0027re helping two dogs - the one you\u0027re welcoming into your home, and the next dog who will be able to join our program."

    "description": "At first glance, it might appear that Monty is channeling his inner Eeyore. With those soulful puppy dog eyes and that prominent underbite, he has a way of pulling at our heartstrings. But don\u0027t be fooled! This fun-loving boy is all wiggles and wags when he\u0027s playing with toys or exploring the great outdoors. Runners and hikers, take note! if you\u0027re looking for the perfect trail companion, Monty is your boy. He goes out on the trail on a regular basis with his Virtual Foster friend. Together, they run side-by-side for miles. Bikers, strollers, dogs, cranky swans and other distractions don\u0027t phase him in the slightest. He truly is a fabulous workout buddy! So if you\u0027re looking for an athletic, sweet-natured, handsome boy, why not go the full Monty? If that face isn\u0027t enough to convince you to take him home immediately, we should also note that he has received rave reviews from his sleepover friend. He proved to be potty trained and a respectful houseguest. He\u0027s also an excellent snoozer and is content to lounge on the couch and keep you company for hours during Netflix marathons. In addition to being a top-notch lounger and trail companion, Monty is also in the Total Obedience Program. The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modelled after the AKC\u0027s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Monty has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help him learn the skills to become the best dog he can be! He is learning skills like sit and down, walking nicely on leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers or other dogs, staying in a sit or down until told \"free,\" and coming when called. Once Monty successfully completes all the skills on his/her training plan he will be considered TOP Dog Ready! Monty is working hard to become a wonderful pet and as a part of APA\u0027s Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with Monty after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA\u0027s CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https://vimeo.com/89434193 So what do you say? Want to come visit this sweet boy today? We have no doubt he will make his forever family very happy one day! Follow Monty on Instagram @ adopt_montythepit https://www.instagram.com/adopt_montythepit/?hl\u003den"

    "description": "Boris is very mature for his age! At only 3 years old he is a very relaxed, dainty gentleman. However, that doesn\u0027t mean he will not play Pirates of the Caribbean with you... ha! get it? Boris has a great sense of humor! He enjoys the occasional toy or rawhide for a little chewing and all the treats in China. That\u0027s the saying, right? He likes to go for leisurely walks making sure to smell the flowers along the way and only picks up speed when he spots a squirrel, lizard, or other such critter...to greet them, of course! After the walk, his fave thing to do is dip in the nearest watering hole to cool off. A car ride that leads him to an exploring adventure and you\u0027ve got the happiest dog on earth! Boris is super cuddly so If you like to watch movies or take naps, he is the perfect companion to cuddle up with on the sofa and do endless Netflix marathons. Texas fall is almost here (right?), so come snatch the perfect body pillow we have to offer."

    "description": "Aby is a lady with special needs, but she\u0027s such a mellow, cooperative girl that she makes caretaking a joy. This sweet girl was found on a street with three puppies and a paralyzed back end. What caused the injury is unknown; what is known is that she\u0027s adapting nicely to life with a disability. In foster care, Aby is learning to walk in her wheelchair and can even roughhouse with her foster dog buddies. She\u0027s happy to be outside watching them roll around playing, and she\u0027s also happy to be in the company of cats and kittens. Skittish at first with her new humans, she\u0027s warmed up and enjoys their petting. And she\u0027s a smart girl who listens well. Because of her paralysis, she wears a diaper; she comes when she hears \"Diaper change! and is very easy to change and carry on to the next adventure. Aby is a calm, easygoing girl who will do best in a quiet home with doggie playmates and maybe kitty buddies. Wouldn\u0027t you want to be the future of Aby\u0027s journey?"

    "description": "Flower is everything her namesakes are known for: soft, vibrant and unique. This pretty girl became a momma dog at a very young age, and after caring for her one surviving puppy, she is now ready to live a life for the books. Wandering in the streets did nothing to Flower\u0027s spirit; she is a playful, naive and gentle big puppy that gets so happy when her foster mom gets home, her entire body wiggles in excitement. As a welcome treat, she will more than likely give you her belly for some rubs, while you tell her all about your day; her adoring hazel eyes can make anything better. Flower shares her foster home with two canine siblings of different sizes and she does very well with them. She has demonstrated to be very playful and patient in her play with her own little puppy and may benefit from canine friends that can teach her a trick or two on socializing - she is very interested in learning! She walks perfectly in tune with her foster while strutting around the neighborhood and is crate trained. Due to her gentle disposition, a nice feline roommate is a possibility. Flower spent most of her life waiting for the chance to bloom. Could you be the sunshine to help her grow?"

In a word, Brindle is gorgeous. He\u0027s also incredibly sweet and has the most soulful eyes. If that\u0027s not reason enough to take him out for a visit, you should know that Brindle is a model houseguest with A+ ratings in the home. This elegant, long-legged boy knows how to mind his manners indoors. He\u0027s potty-trained, happy to go inside a crate, and a good boy on his own while his people are out doing human things. So if you\u0027re looking for a dog that will easily adjust to most homes, Brindle is your boy! Though he loves his couch time, Brindle enjoys stretching those long legs out on the trail, where he will happily walk right by your side at a leisurely pace. Bust out the rope toy and he\u0027ll morph into a giant puppy dog. You know it\u0027s game time when he strikes his adorable play-bow! If you\u0027ve got treats, he\u0027ll show you his tricks! This boy is super smart and already knows some behavioral skills. He\u0027s a quick study and always eager to please his human friends. Trust us, when you meet him you\u0027ll see he\u0027s all the dog you\u0027ll ever need!"
