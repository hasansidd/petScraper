    "description": "Content, Quiet, Special Winnie is a mellow and happy girl. She likes to watch the world go by from her window perch (aka Cat TV), to chase the laser light, and to battle string toys. She plays with other cats but prefers privacy when she takes a nap. And if you have a vacant lap, she will take up residence in it and purr! Winnie was born with Manx Syndrome, a defect that causes her to be incontinent. This means she needs a compassionate owner who will help her express her urine a few times a day; this sounds harder than it actually is, and APA! will provide instruction on how to do it. Winnie doesn\u0027t have a tail, which is totally cute, but it is also helpful in keeping her clean - she is so accommodating! Winnie has beautiful green eyes and a sweet demeanor. She must always remain an indoor cat, but she does like to bask outside in a protected, enclosed area, such as a chicken coop or a rabbit hutch (without the chickens or rabbits, of course!). If you are looking to adopt a wonderful cat who also has special needs, we think you should meet Winnie. She will completely love you back. Contact us to meet her today! All APA! cats and kittens are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Winnie, please email [email protected]",

    "description": "Loving, Playful, Adorable Say hello to sweet little Gracie! This gorgeous girl just wants to be with you. She\u0027ll follow you around the house, even patiently sitting outside the shower. She likes to snuggle up beside you or lay by your feet. She enjoys equal parts of playtime and nap time. She bats at mice on strings and chases other toys on her own. Gracie is a special kitty with special needs. She was left incontinent after a car accident and has limited use of her back legs. Because of her condition, Gracie needs to have her bladder expressed twice a day; and since she can\u0027t quite groom her rear end, she would greatly benefit from having a monthly shave back there to prevent matting (she\u0027s such a fluffy girl!). She has few troubles with the litter box - she kicks litter and sometimes misses the box. Sometimes when you\u0027re in the bathroom, Gracie will come running so she can have her potty time, too! She knows the drill. She is a smart, willing girl who handles her differences with dignity, and she is looking for her human companion who can do the same. Gracie has not met any children or dogs, and has enjoyed being with other cats who aren\u0027t dominant and don\u0027t bully her; sometimes other cats try to bully her, which is not nice at all, especially since Gracie is such a nice girl! Because she enjoys the company of other cats, it would be great to find a home with a cat who would accept her and be her buddy. She\u0027d be the perfect cat for someone who wants a truly loving and devoted companion. This total sweetheart is waiting to meet her best friend and find her ideal forever home. If you\u0027re looking to make a huge difference in a little kitty\u0027s life, contact us today to meet Gracie. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Friendly, Cuddler, Precious They don\u0027t call this kitty O\u0027Purry for nothing! This sweetheart adores cuddling in your lap and purring away. O\u0027Purry has some special needs that make her different than your typical cat. But, her desire for affection and love are the same as any people-loving kitty as well as her happy purr. Being different doesn\u0027t matter to O\u0027Purry, but being loved most certainly does. O\u0027Purry has a condition that is called Manx Syndrome. This means she was born without a tail and a shorter spine than most cats which has caused her to be fecally incontinent, and she also needs her bladder expressed a couple of times a day -- we know that sounds scary, but don\u0027t worry! Her foster and our vets will walk you through how to care for O\u0027Purry and her special needs. O\u0027Purry is easy to express and has no problems as long as you express her regularly (morning, lunch, after work and before bed). She will probably have to wear a diaper her entire life, but she doesn\u0027t let that stop her. She is a brave kitty, takes all of this all in stride, and still plays like a happy, confident kitten! O\u0027Purry, because of her shortened spine, also walks a bit differently than other cats. She gets around just fine, and is cute as a button! She moves more like a rabbit than a cat and can be heard hopping around from downstairs. She is able to climb up a cat tree but has to work hard to jump up on a chair. She loves to play with balls and mice and likes other cats. When O\u0027Purry finishes her kitty games, she will seek out your lap to sit and then the o\u0027purry sets in and she purrs and purrs with delight! Caring for a special needs pet may take less time and money than you think... and the life you\u0027ll save is priceless along with the love that you\u0027ll receive. Contact APA! to find out more about O\u0027Purry and to set up a meet and greet with the purriest of kitties today! All APA! kittens are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Outgoing, Goofy, Cat-Social Holly George has the cutest booty! He is an orange tabby/Manx mix so his tail is super short, giving him an adorable bunny bum. He is affectionate with all people and loves to be petted. In fact, he will tap you on the arm to request for you to pet him! He also will give you nose kisses - touch his nose gently and sweetly to yours - to let you know how much he loves you. Super sweet and loving! Holly George has Manx Syndrome; basically, the gene that gave him his short tail also shortened his spine, which caused him to be incontinent and unable to pee on his own. This is where you come in! His human needs to \"express - apply light pressure in a particular way - Holly George\u0027s bladder a few times a day to help him urinate. For more information, please contact APA! In addition to people, Holly George is social with other cats, too, and would love to have a feline buddy (or two) to hang out with in his new home. He has grown up around cats of all ages and accepts all of them. He will snuggle with them and groom them, and he will play with them, too! He also likes a variety of toys - balls, string toys, feather toys - and a scratching post to scratch and climb. He is young and active! Holly George has some special needs, and we think the perfect home for him is with patient people who will love and appreciate him! His human companion should be able to express his bladder and keep him clean (he is a little sensitive around his back end, so he likes to be handled gently); other than that, all Holly George needs is company, love and affection, and to be played with. He would be best with adults and young adults, rather than little kids. Though Holly George is friendly and outgoing, he likely will need time to adapt to his new home and family. But once he is comfortable, we think you will agree that he is an over-the-top wonderful cat! Contact us today for more information, and to set up a meet and greet. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

She won\u0027t settle into your lap for petting, but she definitely loves for you to pet her! She does well with children, and would probably prefer a home with a family who was around more often than not; she is independent, but she appreciates attention and company. Stacy loves humans, but is not a fan of other cats, so would do best as the only feline in the home. Stacy is FeLV+ (Feline Leukemia Virus), which causes a weakened immune system and requires special care. APA! provides some medical assistance after adoption. Cats with FeLV typically have a shortened lifespan. Stacy is not contagious to people or dogs, but should live only with other FeLV+ cats. For more information, please contact APA! or read more by our partner, Best Friends Animal Society: http://bestfriends.org/Resources/FAQs-About-Feline-Leukemia-Virus-FeLV/ Stacy makes the cutest purr-chirp sound when she wants your attention; for example, when she is looking for interaction with you or if her food dish is empty. You have to hear it for yourself - there aren\u0027t the right letters in the alphabet to spell it! Stacy will make someone a great companion cat, so contact us today if she sounds perfect for you!

    "description": "Are you looking for a spitfire companion full of sass? Do you have a soft spot for heartthrobs with checkered pasts? Would you like to take a walk on the wild side? Then meet Boris, Austin\u0027s very own beautiful bad boy with a heart of gold! Like most bad boys, Boris has had a few run-ins with the law; when you look deeper, though, you can easily get past the naughty exterior to see his perspective. Before he came to APA!, Boris had the misfortune of having his front paws declawed, and he\u0027s understandably upset about this turn of events. Without his claws, Boris can\u0027t defend himself the same way that other cats can. The world is a lot scarier when you feel helpless, and poor Boris suffers from some anxiety problems that cause him to lash out using the only defense he has left- his teeth. Boris does have a bite history, and will need a compassionate adopter who is willing to look past his bad habits. In return, however, Boris will reveal his heart of gold and reward his family with all of the love, snuggles, and head butts anyone could ask for. At heart, this bad boy is really a snuggle bug, who loves to be pet, scratched, and brushed, and who will even put his paws on your shoulders to give you a hug! Boris is a staff favorite at APA!, and many of the cat program counselors have fallen in love with him as he climbed on their shoulders or took a snooze on their laps. Funny and quirky, this boy loves to take the spotlight with his playful antics. He can often be found chasing balls around his enclosure, wrestling with his roommates, or stealing all the attention of anyone who comes to visit. Boris, with his dreamy fluffy white fur and striking splashes of orange tabby stripes, knows that he deserves the spotlight, and will demand it! Boris does well with other cats in the shelter, but needs to be in an animal-free home - he wants to be the center of your attention. Boris is absolutely not interested in kids of any species! This bachelor is childfree for life and proud of it, and will not be adopted to a home with children. Because of his struggles with fear-based aggression, he takes an easy once-daily anxiety medication that has helped him enormously. On the medication, Boris is much more comfortable with the world around him and much more able to be the sweetheart we know he is inside. What Boris really needs, however, is someone in his corner who will be patient and compassionate, who will protect him and make him feel comfortable and loved, and who will act as his advocate to the world and understand his needs. If this sounds like you, come meet Boris today! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Boris, please email [email protected]",

    "description": "Purr-Master, Sweetheart, Snuggler There\u0027s no doubt that George Ezra\u0027s charming personality and quirky kitty ways would inspire his human namesake to sing a song about him. There\u0027s just something about a vibrant orange fluffball happily climbing into your lap, kneading away and drifting off to sleep that makes you feel all cozy and...well...that just makes you want to sing! George not only adores people, he loves playing with other cats and to snuggle and get baths from them. He also enjoys gazing out the window with a kitty friend by his side. He has a wonderful purr and is just as content snuggling and sleeping as he is playing. When George does play, he loves a go-round with a rascally string toy or trying to take down those pesky laser pointers! George is FeLV+ (Feline Leukemia Virus), which causes a weakened immune system and requires special care. APA! provides some medical assistance after adoption. Cats with FeLV typically have a shortened lifespan. George is not contagious to people or dogs, but should live only with other FeLV+ cats. For more information, please contact APA! or read more by our Partner, Best Friends Animal Society: http://bestfriends.org/Resources/FAQs-About-Feline-Leukemia-Virus-FeLV/ George is under the weather sometimes and takes medication that helps him feel better. He is such a lovebug, you won\u0027t find a sweeter cat! This little fellow also has impeccable manners, always using his litterbox and only scratching his toys, not the furniture! George would absolutely thrive in a loving home where a lap or two is readily available and with human friends who are comfortable giving him the medical care he needs to keep this precious guy as healthy as possible. Young kids may be a bit much for him, but gentle older children and adults would most certainly keep his purr motor going strong. Contact APA! today to meet this orange delight! All APA! kittens are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Calm - Friendly - Happy Mia is a beautiful black and golden tortie. She\u0027s a senior gal who is more interested in naps and pets than in racing about the house and bouncing off walls. She can be a little shy at first, but once she has gotten to know you, you could not ask for a more affectionate cat. She loves to be curled up by your side while you watch Netflix, or read a good book, or play X-box. Mia loves attention, and would love a home where her special people are home a lot to give her the affection she craves. She would be the perfect fit for a housebound senior, or a young professional who has a home office! Or a homemaker who will let her sit at their side as they take care of their house. Mia has Chronic Renal Disease, which means her kidneys are not functioning as well as they once were. This condition is so common in older cats that APA! offers a special adoption package for them. Read more about renal failure and adoption details here: http://www.austinpetsalive.org/2016/03/lives-worth-saving-cats-in-renal-failure We can tell you this: it will be well worth the extra care to have this sweet face greet you at the door every day. Mia gets along fine with the other cats in the cattery, so would do well with a calm feline companion with a similar low-key activity level. Or she could flourish as an only cat, and keep all your attention for herself! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Mia, please email [email protected]",

    "description": "Curious, Affectionate, Patient If you are looking for a cat overflowing with personality, Hector can deliver that - and more! When Hector first goes home with you, he will probably hide for a bit, so be gentle and patient with him. He doesn\u0027t mind if you seek him out in his safe hidey-hole; he will accept your petting! This is how you prove to him that you are a trustworthy human (we suspect people in his previous life were not trustworthy or dependable). And once he trusts you, he will seek YOU out for petting; he may even be a little pushy about it! Eventually, he will become your total lap cat. And not only that! When Hector relaxes and is comfortable in his new home, he will purr constantly! If he is not in your lap, he is content to sit across the room from you, gazing at you with love, making little cooing sounds at you. How cute is that!? Hector knows his name and will respond when you call him. He is mostly a mellow guy, but just when you think you have defined him, he will change it up; he may run around the house, chasing who-knows-what, playfully throwing his toys around, jumping up on things to get a better view of his domain! Hector has an ulcer on his tongue that makes it look like he is sticking his tongue out. We don\u0027t know if it is due to genetics, his immune system, or allergies; it is stubborn to completely heal, so a biopsy will be done to figure out what it is and what can be done to get it to heal. Hector is a healthy FIV+ (Feline Immunodeficiency Virus) cat. FIV+ cats typically live long, healthy lives! For more information, please contact APA! or read this FAQ: http://bestfriends.org/Resources/FAQs-About-Feline-Immunodeficiency-Virus-FIV Hector needs a low-traffic home with patient, cat-experienced adults. He seems interested in other cats, but we don\u0027t know how he interacts with them. He has good scratching habits and would do best with a large litter box, or even one with a cover. Hector is quirky and loving and talkative, quite simply a GREAT cat! He loves his people once you get through that getting-to-know-you period. He is alert, curious, and inquisitive. And fabulous and silly! We could go on and on, but contact us to meet him for yourself! Your cup will runneth over. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Friendly, Calm, Easy-going Minerva is a relaxed, friendly, and great companion who is always happy to see you! She will spend as much time as possible sitting next to you, and prefers that to sitting in your lap (though she doesn\u0027t mind being picked up). She loves pets and will even let you rub her tummy and feet. She will follow you around for attention and affection, may lick your knees or feet, and then will rub her face on them! Hint, hint: she loves you. When Minerva is hungry or wants affection she meows or makes a cute chirping sound, but otherwise she is quiet. She is not crazy-playful, but will stalk, chase, and pounce on mouse-string toys and feather toys. So far, other toys don\u0027t hold that kind of interest for her, but you might discover other ones that do. Typically, she won\u0027t jump up to high places, but if you are eating food on a low coffee table, beware: she is not shy about trying to steal it from you! Minerva was underweight when rescued, and though she is gaining weight, she will likely remain a petite cat. Like many people, Minerva is taking medicine for hyperthyroidism, but takes it like a champ. She is a beautiful tabby with cute eyes ringed in black and a white chin. And she has teeny-tiny paws! She has not interacted with kids or dogs, and has kept her distance from the resident adult cat in her foster home. The ideal home for Minerva would be with adults or teens, preferably with people who work from home or are at home much of the time; we think it wouldn\u0027t suit her to be alone all day, every day. A home with low-key pets would likely be fine, with a slow and proper introduction. Minerva is in good health for an older kitty. She does take medicine for hyperthyroidism, we can show you how to give it to her. In a rather unusual twist for a cat, Minerva is a very deep sleeper! She likes to have her own comfy bed to nap in when she\u0027s not keeping you company. If Minerva sounds like the perfect doll for you, contact us today to meet her! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Affectionate, Sweet, Regal Muffin is a love muffin! She needs a little time to warm up to you, but once she does she will be looking to give \"rubby-rubs to her humans and will happily accept a good ear and chin rub in return. When you get home she will greet you at the door and she will guard your bed with every inch of her body when you\u0027re sleeping. This lovely senior lady really knows how to make you feel special! Muffin is low-maintenance and is very energetic for a cat her age. She loves to play, especially with her favorite toy which is simple, yet so entertaining...a good ol\u0027 piece of string. She could give much younger cats lessons in proper string pouncing--none of that on the floor stuff, she catches hers while it\u0027s still up in the air! Muffin doesn\u0027t scratch on furniture and is a pro at using the litter box. She\u0027s quiet most of the time, but will start talking when she gets hungry. When it comes to being petted, she doesn\u0027t like for you to try and pet her from an angle she can\u0027t see and would prefer that you don\u0027t touch her pretty tortie tail. But, she is happy to accept love from you, as long as it\u0027s given on her terms! The ideal home for Muffin would include a patient adopter who is willing to give her time to acclimate to her new surroundings. Muffin would be comfortable with older kids who give her the space she needs, but younger children would be a bit much for this old gal. Muffin isn\u0027t happy when she sees the other cats in her foster home. So, she may have been the only kitty in her previous household and would likely do best as the solo cat. A low-energy dog would probably be fine if a slow introduction is made. Give Muffin the love and understanding she needs and she\u0027ll spend the rest of her life returning the favor tenfold to her most special and adored person...you! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Sweet, Senior, Social We can\u0027t tell you about Anderson\u0027s past because she was found as a stray by a Good Samaritan, but we can tell you that she is a sweet old girl! She may look big and tough in her photo, but she\u0027s actually petite. When Anderson first came to APA!, she was purring so loudly that the technicians giving her a physical couldn\u0027t hear her heartbeat! She is appreciative of the attention she receives, and will quietly lean into you for more pets. She is social and likes to be around people. Anderson likes being petted on her head, but prefers that you don\u0027t touch her legs or tail. She will lick you and give you kitty kisses, though sometimes the kisses turn into love nips - all the while purring! Then she will lick you again. Finally, she will sit in your lap, again with her trademark purring; which seems to get louder, the happier she is. She does all this to show you that she has accepted you as her special human companion. Anderson is good with other cats that leave her alone, so she should be be able to live with another cat, as long as they respect her and don\u0027t bully her. Because of her love nips, little kids should be supervised around her, but she should be fine with older kids who understand and appreciate her quirks. Don\u0027t think that because of her age that Anderson isn\u0027t playful, because she would prove you wrong! Stick toys are her favorite. She will do her version of running after it (walking quickly), bat it around, pounce on it, bite it, and subdue it. Anderson also gets very excited about wet food and treats! She has perfect litter box habits, though she needs a large box with high sides and/or a cover, because she will hang her hiney over the box - crouching is hard for her, so this will keep her inside the box and accident-free. So we don\u0027t know what kind of life Anderson had before, but we know for sure the remainder of her life should be with people who would love an older-yet-still-spunky cat as their feline companion. Contact us today to set up a meet and greet with this lovely senior! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Anderson, please email [email protected]",

    "description": "Affectionate, Mannerly, Lap Cat Hayden loves being around people because 1) they have a lap, and 2) they give pets! In his world, head scratches are the best. He will step all over your tummy or laptop, if you\u0027re working, to get your attention. But he is super sweet and gentle about it! Hayden is a handsome fellow, always dressed to the nines in a tasteful gray tux. You can tell he\u0027s got the Emily Post manners thing down, because he uses the litter box like a gent, and he minds the furniture as well. Right-o! Hayden has diabetes and requires some extra medical care, which may include regulated diet and/or insulin. For more information, please contact APA! But he is splendid about taking his medicine. No fuss at all. That would be bad form. He is rather enthusiastic about food, which is probably caused by the diabetes; but of course he is polite and well-behaved about it. And he\u0027s an affectionate cuddler. If he could talk, he\u0027d probably recite a bit of Shelley or Byron while lounging in your lap. His ideal home would be with someone who would love him and give him affection. He would do likely be fine with other pets, and even kids. Contact us today to set up a meet and greet - you won\u0027t be able to resist his puppy-dog eyes! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip.

    "description": "Beautiful, Reserved, Polite Unlike her namesake, Pinky Tuscadero is a well-behaved, easy-going gal! She uses the litter box perfectly and has appropriate scratching behavior. Previous to her stay with APA!, Pinky had been front and back declawed. As a result of this she must remain an indoor cat. Pinky will meow to let you know she wants food or treats, and then will wait patiently. She is in a foster home with two cats and a small, mellow dog, and will politely wait for food until it is her turn. She is smart and kindly! Pinky doesn\u0027t play with toys, but she does appreciate some good petting, scratching, and rubbing! She is tall and lean with beautiful brown and gold tortoiseshell markings. Pinky has diabetes and requires some extra medical care, which may include regulated diet and/or insulin; right now her diabetes is controlled with her diet. For more information, please contact APA! Pinky would do well in a home with other adult cats and teenagers; it takes her a while to warm up to young kids, and since she is demure and reserved, she would be a perfect companion for older humans. Pinky is precious! Contact us today to meet your new best friend. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip.

    "description": "Curious, Docile, Loving If you are looking to love a unique cat and can accept his disabilities as part of his charm - and give him the care he requires - Dexter is the cat for you! Dexter had to have one eye removed and has limited vision in the remaining eye, has shortened front legs that affect his mobility and the way he walks, and has an occasional seizure. If you couldn\u0027t already guess, Dexter has had a hard life - he wasn\u0027t treated well and didn\u0027t get the medical care he needed. The good news - the great news! - is that Dexter is an affectionate, social, and relaxed guy. He\u0027s actually pretty low-maintenance now that his medical issues have been addressed. Because of his short legs he can\u0027t climb into a litter box - balancing in litter is hard for him, too - but he\u0027s been successful using pee pads (he prefers his pee pad to be in a non-carpeted location). Sometimes he doesn\u0027t make it there in time, but it\u0027s not because he isn\u0027t trying. His human companion needs to be okay with this. Dexter will meow when he wants dinner and will follow you around; he has a wobbly, stumbly walk that is endearing and comical. Being close to you is important to him, so you can expect that he will lie on the floor at your feet, waiting patiently for you to pet him. He especially likes for you to pet him around his face and tail; rub his face, and he will lick you. He doesn\u0027t care for being picked up (it makes him nervous), and prefers to get his petting on the floor. Dexter doesn\u0027t play much, but that might change as he gets used to you and his new home; recently, he has been seen \"running\" (his version of running) from room-to-room in his foster home, so his foster family is planning to encourage him in some gentle games. He will move around the house to drink water, eat food, and use the pee pad, but otherwise he likes to find a comfy spot and hang out there all day, grooming himself now and then. Dexter lives with a dog in his foster home, and will sleep as close to him as he can (within six inches)! He probably wouldn\u0027t like a home with a very active dog, but he is cool with a cat-friendly, mellow pup. Similarly, Dexter is not the companion for a child. He lived with other cats in his previous life (though we don\u0027t know how they got along), but he seems fine and dandy as the only cat. Dexter is not the cat for you if you are not cat-experienced and able to love him and accommodate his special needs. His home should not have any stairs, since he can\u0027t navigate them and doesn\u0027t want to be carried around. He embodies courage and determination, maneuvering around despite his disabilities. He is relaxed and adorable, and just wants to live a comfortable life. If you can provide this for him, he will love you forever and leave a little paw print on your heart, every day. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Dexter, please email [email protected]",

    "description": "Meet Merlin: he\u0027s 7 pounds of pure Tuxedo cat magic, and he\u0027s ready to cast a spell on you. Merlin craves affection, and defies all those aloof feline stereotypes. He will lie blissfully in your arms, gazing up at you with his enchanting green eyes. And at night, he will cuddle against you as he drifts off into kitty dreamland. Not only does Merlin love people, he also exhibits zero fear of the easy-going, 60-lb dog in his foster home. He has even started to copy the actions and behavior of his best canine buddy. Maybe he\u0027s working on his shapeshifting powers? Either way, Merlin seems to have taken quite a liking to his canine roommate! He seems interested in his foster\u0027s resident cat too, though she\u0027s not so sure about him so far. You can\u0027t charm \u0027em all! Merlin had a rough start to life before coming to his current foster, but that hasn\u0027t changed his good nature. He suffered from a broken tail and a neurological injury, which mostly make him extra excited and chatty at mealtimes, and a little sensitive about the touching of his hindquarters. But can you blame a guy? None of this slows him down though, and he\u0027s a master feather wand hunter to boot. Merlin would do best in a home with a cat-experienced adult or adults, with plenty of soft surfaces for this special guy. A little bit of love and affection goes a long way, and we feel that Merlin will truly shine with the right family. If you\u0027re seeking years of conjured up purrs, tender paw taps, and lots of love (without the need for a love potion), Merlin may be the perfect cat for you. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Shy, Curious, Playful Chulo is a beautiful, jet black senior kitty with bright green eyes! She is looking for a patient and kind human to help her come out of her shell; the key to her heart is gentle petting and lots of love. Chulo spent her life in a loving home with other cats and dogs, but sadly, her human passed away, and Chulo\u0027s life completely changed. She is understandably nervous about new places and people since leaving her home. When you meet her, it might be on her terms; she may have found a safe place to hide for a while - like under a bed - until she feels safe and comfortable. But she doesn\u0027t mind if you pet her while she rests in her hidey-hole! Chulo has a strong, happy purr and can be quite affectionate with people she trusts. She is very polite, uses her litterbox consistently, plays with toys, and takes advantage of scratching posts instead of furniture. Chulo is a sweet kitty who\u0027s ready to settle in to her forever home! She would do best in a quiet, low-traffic home and would probably mesh well with other easy-going cats (she\u0027s doing great with the younger cat who is sharing her foster home!), and maybe even a cat-friendly dog. She takes a while to warm up, but if you\u0027re patient she\u0027ll reward you with plenty of purrs! Contact us today to arrange a meet and greet with Chulo. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Chulo, please email [email protected]",

    "description": "Gentle, Sweet, Beautiful Marlena is a beautiful calico cat with very soft fur, eyes that are a lovely shade of green and she has really cute facial expressions. She is a very sweet and gentle dignified older lady who is a little shy at first. With time and patience she comes out of her shell and is very friendly. She likes to sit next to her foster mom and \"helps\" when she is working on her laptop. She is a cuddly sleeper and will give a big purr when she gets petted. She is not particularly playful but does enjoy a little play with a catnip toy from time to time and really loves and needs some sort of scratching post/board. For the most part, she likes to take it easy but meal time and treat time get her super excited. She generally doesn\u0027t like other cats but is not aggressive when she gets to know them. It is unknown how she would feel about dogs or children but all indications are she would not be a fan. She would probably prefer a home when she gets to be the only pet and queen of the castle. Marlena has diabetes and was left at the shelter due to the diagnosis. She just needs a quite home with loving humans who can give her a little special attention and love. She requires some extra medical care which includes a regulated diet and insulin injections along with monitoring. She appears to have some limited vision which is customary for diabetic cats. For more information, please contact APA! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

Behind those gorgeous peepers is a deep thinker...cautious, because how can you know whether friend or foe at first, second or third glance? Yet, wanting and hoping to be able to trust because that\u0027s when all the fun and love happen! Baby Boi relishes soft strokes, especially around his jaw and head, and he\u0027ll happily play with kids and adults when he feels confident he\u0027s among friends. You won\u0027t meet a gentler soul or a sweeter one! Baby Boi isn\u0027t big on cuddles, but he will allow you to sneak some in now and then. He\u0027s never aggressive, even when he\u0027s scared. When it comes to being active, he\u0027s more of a sit back and ponder kind than a high energy type. But, he will confidently speak up if he\u0027s in the mood for playing or some tlc. Baby Boi doesn\u0027t like the company of other cats. So, he\u0027d do best in a household where he\u0027s your one and only feline baby. If you\u0027re willing to let Baby Boi get to know you at his own pace, you will be richly rewarded for your time and patience with a friendly, sweetheart of a kitty. If he sounds like the kind of boy you could wrap your heart around, contact us to set up a meet and greet with Baby Boi today!

It was shortly discovered that she was not pregnant but instead had a huge belly from fluid build up secondary to not enough protein in her diet. Since she got here, she has been treated for mange and is loving and friendly. A little too friendly because she love bites when excited:) She would make a great cat in a dog free home. She is terrified of dogs. She is being treated for mange and will go home with meds to finish that up. The mange is only contagious to other cats, not dogs or people so she is safe to take now. She has beautiful green eyes and when her whiskers and fur completely grows back, she will be a looker! Can you give her a place to call home?",

    "description": "Playful, sweet, friendly Any self respecting cat has a favorite toy they love to chase. You know: String, feathered. Balls, jingly. Mouse, catnip. But for this two-year-old calico, the preference is: Tail, Sally\u0027s. Yep, Sally\u0027s her name, her tail is her game. Not that she won\u0027t chase anything else, including other cats, but it\u0027s so much easier when that elusive plaything is built right in. As if to highlight this special relationship, Sally\u0027s main calico marking is...her tail. The rest of her is white, white and more white. She\u0027s is a striking lass. She\u0027s also fastidious and clearly appreciates a clean litter box. If it isn\u0027t up to snuff, she might leave you a message on the outside of the box. Having recently discovered that her scratching posts can be every bit as satisfying as that rug over there, she is still transitioning from the one to the other. Sally does require daily medication to control seizures from idiopathic (having no specific cause) epilepsy. Apart from that she\u0027s as healthy as a cat-size horse. Dogs and children are still a question mark in Sally\u0027s life, but because she\u0027s so playful with other cats, while being respectful of their boundaries, we suspect she\u0027d do well with similarly inclined housemates of any species. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Sweet, sometimes dorky, languorous Munchkin is content to lie as close to you as humanly (or felinely) possible and napping for a good long time, while reserving the right to be lovingly stroked and/or brushed, also for a good long time. She loves to be petted for as long as your hand can last (she always wins that game), and will purrrrrrr to let you know you\u0027re doing it \"right\". She will even lick your hand a little, grooming you as a reward for giving her pets. She is a beautiful, soft, fluffy, cuddly brown tortie, so petting her is a reward in itself. While some cats like to be busy exploring, playing, chasing, leaping, etc., that best describes Munchkin\u0027s past rather than her present. She\u0027s probably had enough fun, chased enough jingly balls and leapt upon enough devious laser dots to last a lifetime. Fifteen years, to be exact. She\u0027s earned a rest. Being the mild-mannered sweetheart that she is, Munchkin doesn\u0027t much care for excitable cats or dogs, and children would likely overwhelm her. Munchkin is looking to be the only pet in a quiet home where she can be doted on as she deserves! Previous to her stay with APA!, Munchkin\u0027s front paws had been declawed. As a result of this, she must remain an indoor cat. Munchkin does have some arthritis in her spine, which can cause discomfort and difficulty getting around, but she\u0027s now on medication for it and is feeling better. She is showing some signs of early-stage kidney issues, but with a proper diet and treatment, she may well have years of cuddling left! Hey, we all get a little creaky as we get older, but we also start to realize there\u0027s nothing better than loving and being loved! And loving you is just what Munchkin wants to spend her life doing! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Munchkin, please email us at [email protected]",

    "description": "Big Boy, Super Chill, Likes to be Loved On Poor Louie has been in his enclosure for too long! He needs room to run and play, and he\u0027s bored to tears! Well, OK, not tears, but some occasional crabby behavior. You\u0027d be grumpy, too, if you were cooped up with no freedom in sight. Louie does like playing with toys and with his bunkmate Danny Boy, but he just tolerates the other cats in his enclosure. They have occasional skirmishes, though we can\u0027t tell who the instigator is. Louie also seeks human attention, and really enjoys being loved on. We think he\u0027d be good with older, respectful kids, especially if they play with him. We haven\u0027t seen him with dogs. Louie would be so happy to finally have a forever home of his own! We know he really is a good kitty - he just needs room to run and people to give him the attention he needs. He\u0027d like to go home with his buddy Danny Boy - having a familiar friend at his side would help him transition to a new environment more easily. Danny Boy has his own bio, so check it out! You can see pictures and action videos of Louie, Danny Boy, and their other kitty buddies on this Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/NutterButtercat/ All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Louie, please email us at [email protected]",

    "description": "Dapper, Regal, Sweet Jack is a sweet old kitty who just wants a family to love. He\u0027s a very chill guy. He prefers hugs, pets and lap time to shenanigans. He sometimes stares at you with his toungue partially out and he sometimes falls asleep sitting up... it\u0027s SO CUTE! Jack was found outside. He\u0027s been declawed and he had to have his teeth removed. He still adores people, even children. He\u0027d do great with a gentle buddy who wants to snuggle instead of play. He\u0027s tolerant of other cats and will sleep by them or a share a window ledge with them. Jack is also FeLV+ (Feline Leukemia Virus), which causes a weakened immune system and requires special care. APA! provides some medical assistance after adoption. Cats with FeLV typically have a shortened lifespan. Sterling is not contagious to people or dogs, but should live only with other FeLV+ cats. For more information, please contact APA! or read more by our Partner, Best Friends Animal Society: http://bestfriends.org/Resources/FAQs-About-Feline-Leukemia-Virus-FeLV Jack wants to find himself a calm, big family to take care of him. He wants to lay in the window and snooze. That\u0027s the least we can do for this gentle, sweet guy who\u0027s stayed positive and loving through it all. Do you have the love and affection he needs? All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "ndependent, Shy, Mellow Not everyone is pretty enough to strut down the runway, but true to her name, Sashay can! This gorgeous gal is a real beauty queen with her soft white coat and big hazel eyes; she\u0027s so well groomed, she\u0027s even done her eyebrows (the small gray smudges above her eyes). Sashay is a dignified kitty and while she enjoys playing, it\u0027s not with any riff-raff (aka other cats) around. If your living room was high school, she\u0027d play singles tennis or golf. She also enjoys lounging in a cozy spot, with or without her person nearby. When Sashay decides it\u0027s time for cuddles, she\u0027ll let out a little meow to get your attention. After that, she prefers chin and hindquarters scratches and sporadically enjoys a belly rub or two. Given Sashay\u0027s disinclination to be around other cats, she would most likely do poorly with children or dogs. Sashay would be happiest in a home where she can be the star of the show as the only pet, in a family of people who understand that sometimes stars need their space and beauty rest away from their adoring fans. Like any celebrity though, she can\u0027t resist the siren call of the limelight (namely, your lap) and will always come back for more. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Loving, Calm, Sweet \"Love me tender, love me sweet...put me in your lap...\" Elvis has modified the song to fit her cuddly ways! She is such a snuggler whether it\u0027s a lap, your chest or being held in your arms. Reach out and touch her and her purr motor is immediately activated and continues strong and happy as you love on her and as she hopes you never let her go! Elvis may not be the youngest kitty around, but she is as full of life and love as any cat you\u0027ll meet. She\u0027s a very mellow lady whose favorite activity is hanging out with her humans and being petted by them. People find Elvis\u0027 charms irresistible and she also has fans in the animal world. The skittish kitty in her foster home, who doesn\u0027t tolerate the presence of just any cat, amicably relaxes in the same room as Elvis. Then there\u0027s the calm puppy Elvis recently met, they were friends in no time! Elvis does prefer mellow company over high energy acquaintances. So, she would get along best with a cat or dog who has a laid back temperament similar to her own. She would likely to well with respectful, calm children who handle her gently. Elvis has diabetes which is easily managed with a special diet, no insulin shots are needed. You may ask yourself why a gorgeous girl would be named Elvis. We think the answer is in the shape of those alluring eyes of hers and that magnificent profile...very much like the King himself! Elvis would be an outstanding companion cat in a tranquil, loving home. Her purrs will melt away your stress and her serene, affectionate presence will add sweetness to every day. Contact us to meet Elvis and you\u0027ll soon be singing \" I...can\u0027t...help...falling in love...with...you.\" All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip.

    "description": "Mellow, sociable, wise Not long ago, Austin Pets Alive! took in eight (count \u0027em, eight) cats whose owner had just passed away. Seven of them have been adopted. We\u0027d like you to meet number eight. His name is Lily. Yes, \"His.\" And yes, \"Lily.\" Having lived with so many cats, Lily does just fine with newcomers of his species, but isn\u0027t all that interested in snuggling or playing. It\u0027s as if he\u0027s saying, \"Hello there, my name is Lily. Yes...yes...Lily. I get asked that a lot. What do you say we just sit for a while on this nice, soft carpet and take in all the interesting things that are going on in the house? Which reminds me, when\u0027s dinner?\" Of course, Lily has had plenty of experience with humans as well, so he\u0027s perfectly comfortable in their presence...although his preference seems to be sitting NEXT to them rather than ON them. Either way, he\u0027s very pleasant company. Lily\u0027s back is somewhat tender, and he has a bit of arthritis in his hips for which he takes supplements and pain meds. So if his new home does have any children, we\u0027d recommend the gentler the better. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information, or to meet Lily, please email [email protected]",

    "description": "Sweet, Relaxed, Quiet Coco loves to be loved and petted, and will rub her face on your hand when you pet her! She may meow to signal her delight, but otherwise she is a quiet girl. As much as she loves affection from you, she has no need to lie on you or be held; she is content to be next to you! Coco has oddly-shaped front feet (which is congenital, not due to any kind of trauma), so she walks a little slower and differently than other kitties. And while she may shuffle around the house, it doesn\u0027t keep her from zipping to her food dish when it\u0027s mealtime! When she came to APA! she was thin and needed extra nutrition, so she is on a prescription diet of dry and wet food so that she can gain weight and improve her overall health. She definitely likes it, because she eats well and is easy to feed! Coco may bat around a cat toy now and then, but she excels at napping, which is her favorite thing! She lets the dog in her foster home sniff her, but she doesn\u0027t seem to like other cats. We think her ideal home would be with adults, gentle and cat-respectful older children, and maybe an easy-going dog. Coco is a sweetie! Contact us today to arrange a meet \u0026 greet. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Coco, please email [email protected]",

    "description": "Affectionate, laid-back, Purring Champion! Cora was quite shy when she first came to her foster home, but within 2 weeks she had blossomed into a total love bug! She\u0027ll follow you around and tell you how much she wants you to pet her. Her playful side has also emerged, and she enjoys batting balls and crinkle toys around. Cora lives with 6 other foster cats and gets along well with all of them. We haven\u0027t seen her with dogs or kids. She has excellent litter and scratching manners. Cora would do well in a quieter home, with people who will welcome her attention and shower her with the love she craves and deserves. Cora is FeLV+ (Feline Leukemia Virus), which causes a weakened immune system and requires special care. APA! provides some medical assistance after adoption. Cats with FeLV typically have a shortened lifespan. Cora is not contagious to people or dogs, but should live only with other FeLV+ cats.

He\u0027s low-maintenance and doesn\u0027t require a lot of expensive toys or active playtime. All he needs is someone to gently pet him and tell him what a good boy he is. In return, he will be your most loyal and loving friend. Dave LOVES other cats! He would benefit from a cat friend who is super confident and outgoing to show him the ropes.

    "description": "Misunderstood, Quiet, Rough-around-the-edges The first thing you may notice about Donkey are his ears! Which are rather beat up from his previous life. But we think they make him distinctively handsome and a bit mysterious! Donkey would love a home with other cats! He will snuggle with them, groom them, and hang out with them. He is a mellow guy and would do best with a cat with a similar personality; no sassy cats, please. Donkey\u0027s human companions should be young adults or adults - loud noises and unpredictable activity startle and scare him (and he may give an indignant hiss to let you know what he thinks, but nothing more than that), so little, active kids would be too much for him. He needs things on the quiet, routine side! His cat-experienced humans also should be able to give him gentle socialization and the TLC he so richly deserves. Donkey likes to purr! And he likes for you to pet him. Contact us today to meet Donkey! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip.

Some days Macadamia decides to run from you when you enter the room, next thing you know she\u0027s rolling over on the floor asking for belly rubs! She\u0027s always ready to emphatically chat with you about all things kitty and she\u0027s in heaven when you pet her pretty coat. If Macadamia is in full wacky-mode, she will run right into things, then it\u0027s off to play with a wand toy, she loves those! She hasn\u0027t been in a home with kids, but she\u0027d likely acclimate nicely to older, respectful children. We haven\u0027t seen her with dogs, but we suspect she\u0027d take charge and try to boss them around! Macadamia is FeLV+ (Feline Leukemia Virus), which causes a weakened immune system and requires special care. APA! provides some medical assistance after adoption. Cats with FeLV typically have a shortened lifespan. She is not contagious to people or dogs, but should live only with other FeLV+ cats. For more information, please contact APA! or read more by our Partner, Best Friends Animal Society: http://bestfriends.org/Resources/FAQs-About-Feline-Leukemia-Virus-FeLV. Macadamia has lived in kitty group rooms during her entire time at the shelter and has cohabitated with her roomies just fine. She has been known to be slightly litterbox challenged. She almost entirely urinates in the litterbox, but she leaks just a little bit, too. We don\u0027t know why, but it hasn\u0027t worsened at all over time. You might even say it\u0027s part of her quirky charm! We won\u0027t say Macadamia is nutty...that would be too easy! But, entertaining, endearing and cream of the kooky kitties? Oh yes! Contact us today to make it a date with Macadamia! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

Catalie must have been a baker in one of her former nine lives, because this cuddly cutie always seems to be kneading biscuits! While she\u0027s making those biscuits, she\u0027s purring up a storm too. She\u0027s certainly not the type to hold her tongue either!

She\u0027ll hunker down and give a cute little bum wiggle before she pounces on her prey, or she\u0027ll bat at it from below if you hang it above her. After playtime, she\u0027d be happy to cuddle up like a little furry cinnamon roll at your feet, or take a quick cat nap in your lap. Catalie has a great attitude as well. Even when she\u0027s stressed or in a new place, she keeps a cool head and an open heart. Catalie is notably outgoing, and loves the company of people. \"The more the merrier\" is this little lady\u0027s motto! Catalie would do best in a home with people that can give her lots of attention, and nurture her playful spirit. She does quite well with kids, and tolerates other dogs and cats kindly.

She loves a good chin scratch, and we know that in a home, she would come out of her shell even more. She is great with other cats! Because she is a little shy, Tina would prefer to go to a home with no small children (older children fine). Her ideal home would be calm, with another cat for company, and an adopter willing to give her time to become comfortable. She\u0027s got a lot of love to give, she just needs someone to give her a home. Could that person be you?

    "description": "Chatty, Kitten-Sized, Independent Say hello to Stripes, a diminutive little lady who has lots to talk about! Although she is mostly independent and shy, Stripes will open up to if you sit and chat with her for a while. When she\u0027s tucked away, she will happily come out to play if you call her name enough. Stripes is your best chatty friend who is always excited to share her feelings with you. Stripes is extremely active for an older cat, especially in the evening/night. She really loves to pounce on strings and other toys that she can chase around. She lets you know she\u0027s happy while playing by shaking the tip of her tail like a fluffy rattlesnake, punctuated with loud purrs. She also loves cat tunnels for play, to relax in, or just as her go-to place where she knows she always can be comfortable. She also likes to watch the world go by from her window perch (aka: Cat TV). Stripes\u0027 tiny body and features makes her kitten-like in appearance. She\u0027s missing a couple teeth, but that makes her look even cuter! And who wouldn\u0027t love to gaze longingly into her giant eyes? Because Stripes is more active in the evening, she would do best in a home that can give her some attention after dinner time. She should be fine in a household with other cats if they are calm and respect her space. We have yet to see her around kids and dogs. Do you have a window, a few toys, and some love to spare? Stripes is ready to return the favor with lots of purrs and love! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Stripes, please email [email protected]",

    "description": "Silly, playful, friendly You\u0027ve most likely heard the term \"hail fellow, well met,\" possibly while studying the odd Shakespeare play, to describe a person who\u0027s enthusiastically hearty, friendly and congenial. With that in mind, we\u0027d like you to meet Alex, our very own \"hail feline, well met.\" Alex has yet to meet a human who not only takes to him immediately, but finds his warm, sweet personality impossible to resist. They also find his habit of begging for a treat 10 minutes after receiving a treat amusing, even endearing. Alex enjoys being petted, loves nothing more than watching TV with you on the couch and can\u0027t wait to fall asleep with you at night. He\u0027s not really a lap cat, but he\u0027s an excellent \"I want to be right beside this person for the foreseable future\" cat. When people aren\u0027t available, catnip and feather-on-a-srtring toys are an acceptable substitute. How Alex would fare with dogs or kids is an unknown, but he does enjoy play-wrestling with his foster\u0027s other cat. They\u0027re not what you\u0027d call affectionate with each other...just pals. His foster also feels that a small human companion or two would fit right in with Alex\u0027s welcoming, unagressive nature. At the same time, attention hog that he is, being an only pet in the house wouldn\u0027t exactly break his heart. Alex\u0027s caterwauling (yep, that\u0027s where that word comes from) won\u0027t bother you at all, because he doesn\u0027t do any. In fact, he only meows when he is hungry and, even better, when you are about to feed him. With so much to recommend him (and just a couple things he needs to work on) it\u0027s hard to imagine Alex not moving into a loving home with someone real soon. Anyone? Anyone? Alex is FeLV+ (Feline Leukemia Virus), which causes a weakened immune system and requires special care. APA! provides some medical assistance after adoption. Cats with FeLV+ typically have a shortened lifespan. Alex is not contagious to people or dogs, but should live only with other FeLV+ cats. For more information, please contact APA! or read more by our partner, Best Friends Animal Society: http://bestfriends.org/Resources/FAQs-About-Feline Leukemia-Virus-FeLV/ All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information, or to meet Alex, please email [email protected]",

    "description": "Hey there from Adrian! She\u0027s a poised silent beauty with stunning amber eyes. Her classic tortie coat makes her even more captivating. She might be a tad on the introverted side, but she\u0027s known to come out of her shell when she\u0027s around other feline friends. Adrian is more of a wallflower that just needs to be shown how to dance! If you take the lead, she\u0027ll be delighted to follow! She\u0027s cool, calm and collected, and she\u0027s never met a window seat she doesn\u0027t like. Cat naps and curling up in the sunshine is where you\u0027ll find this darling doll. If you give her a little time, she\u0027ll be giving you sweet face rubs before you know it. Adrian would love to be in a quiet home with someone who can give her a little boost of encouragement. She\u0027s extremely sweet, but is shy when there is a lot of stimuli. Adrian does well with other cats, and blossoms when she can share the spotlight with another cool and confident kitty. Adrian is a low-maintenance sweetie. She would be perfect for someone who is on the go, but loves to have a fur friend to come home to. Just give her a window and some cuddles, and she will always be waiting for you to walk in the door. Contact us today to meet Adrian! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

She\u0027s very loving, and wants to be someone\u0027s lap cat. However, her time on the streets have made her a little wary, and her special humans will need to give her gentle encouragement to continue her transition to adored indoor lap-cat. She will reward you with lots of love and purrs! Sunnie loves to cuddle and play with the resident cat in her foster home, and would love to go to a home with another kitty for company. She is not, however, a fan of dogs, although she can tolerate them if they keep a respectful distance. Sunnie can be a tiny bit skittish, and for this reason, we don\u0027t recommend a home with small children, although older children would be fine.

    "description": "Shy, Loving, Easy Mimi is a beautiful senior cat with mesmerizing eyes. As an older gal, she prefers to spend her days lounging around, making her ideal for an owner who works during the day. She doesn\u0027t really enjoy being picked up, however, once night rolls around, she loves to come find you to get pets and some good cuddles! You won\u0027t have to question when this affectionate girl needs petting, because she\u0027ll definitely let you know by grabbing your hand with her paw! She\u0027ll also chase cat toys and bat them around on her own now and then. But, overall she prefers napping to playing. Mimi is pretty quiet most of the time but likes chirping and purring to get attention rather than meowing. Although she is a little shy at first, it only takes her a couple of days to warm up. Once that happens, this easygoing, sweet girl absolutely loves to hop in your bed and snuggle with you at night! Her favorite thing to do is to put her little nose in front of your face while you\u0027re sleeping and purr to get your attention. She is skittish around kids and most likely would be the same with dogs. So, a home without either would be best. Mimi would do well in a tranquil household with one or more adults who will give her the time she needs to warm up and who enjoy soft, kitty snuggles. If this sounds like you, contact us to meet Mimi today! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip.

    "description": "Curious, cautious, charming Before we introduce Sadie, a little etymological background (oh, yay). The name Sadie started off as a nickname for the Hebrew name Sarah, both meaning \"princess.\" Personality-wise, a \"Sarah\" is said to be serious \u0026 sweet while a \"Sadie\" has more sass and spunk. Our Sadie clearly missed the memo. Short on sass and spunk, this lovely tortie takes her time and gets to know you before she permits your gently skritching fingertips to move from the top of her head to her upper body and eventually the rest of her. After that, she\u0027ll come trotting up any time she sees, hears (or even senses) your fingers rubbing together. Sadie hasn\u0027t been particularly active since she arrived, which her foster suspects is a reaction to not having her litter of kittens to fuss over anymore. When it\u0027s nap time or she needs to feel safe, she slithers under the comforter on the bed and curls up like a little pill bug. When she feels your touch or, even better, smells her favorite wet food, she returns to normal size and rejoins the life of the house. Her foster\u0027s younger cats love the snuggly attention they get from Sadie, and vice versa. The older cats do not, even though Sadie seems cautiously willing. A calm, welcoming house with one, maybe two other friendly felines (more than that might overwhelm her) should be great for Sadie. Along with plenty of room to explore and feel safe and have fun. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

He is afraid of humans at this point, and if you move your hand towards him to pet him, don\u0027t take it personal if he moves out of reach. He\u0027s just not sure about this trust thing yet. The way to Eclipse\u0027s heart is through playing! His playfulness overcomes his shyness (while he\u0027s playing) - just move a wand toy around or toss a ping pong ball for him, and he goes into action. He\u0027s still not sure about trusting you, but you get high marks in his eyes for playing with him. And speaking of his eyes - he has big, beautiful, golden eyes! Eclipse is comfortable around other cats; he will play and cuddle with his feline roommates! His new home should be with patient, cat-savvy people who will give him time to bloom on his own schedule - and probably a friendly cat to buddy up with.

    "description": "Beautiful - Sweet - Affectionate Look at that sweet little tortie face! Cassatt is the perfect kitten for a retired couple, or a single person with a fairly calm and quiet home looking for a little snuggle buddy. Initially shy, once she is comfortable with you, she is very sweet and affectionate. She loves to be pet and will march around making biscuits and she likes her tummy rubbed. Her favorite time of the day is when her foster comes home and goes to bed for the night - Cassatt loves to snuggle up right beside her and get pets and fall asleep! Whereas her sister bounces off the walls 24/7 with kitten energy, Cassatt is generally more on the mellow side. When Cassatt is EXTRA happy, she makes adorable little faces! This normally occurs when you scratch the bridge of her nose. She will open her mouth slightly and close her eyes in bliss! Sometimes when you stop too early, she will keep her mouth open and lean in and open her eyes SUPER wide as if to say \"Oh no! Why have you stopped petting me?\" Cassatt also has extra thick, luxurious fur. She has been in a foster home almost all of her life, so she\u0027s been well fed and cared for the entire time! This shows in her beautiful coat. We wouldn\u0027t quite call her medium haired, but it\u0027s very thick and bunny soft. She loves other cats! She would benefit from an outgoing cat friend. She\u0027s very sweet with all cats she meets. Cassatt is a little scared of dogs, but has done well with her foster\u0027s dog who totally ignores her. She\u0027d likely do just fine with a calm and gentle dog, or maybe a low energy senior. Cassatt\u0027s best life will be in a home with another cat for company, and mostly adult humans, or maybe some older kids, with the time and patience to give her space while she warms up. It will probably take a little bit of time, but she is very worth the effort! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Cassatt, please email [email protected]",

    "description": "Talkative - Sweet - Shy Like his namesake Nick Fury, this Nick only has one eye,which gives him a jaunty look but causes no pain. Shy for a bit until he gets to know you, once you\u0027re friends, you will discover that he\u0027s a chatty kitty who loves to carry on a conversation with you. He also LOVES his cat toys. If you will play with him with his toys, you will become his friend in short order. Nick Furry is also independent, though, and will happily play with his toys alone when you\u0027re too busy. This little fellow adores the company of other kitties and would be happiest in a home with at least one other cat to cuddle and play with. He\u0027ll melt your heart with his loving grooming and snuggles that he imparts to the other kitties. Nick Furry would do best in a home without dogs or small children as he is easily frightened. Nick\u0027s ideal home would be quiet and stable, with another FeLV+ kitty for company, and lots of toys and pets from his special human. He\u0027ll reward you with lots of love! Nick Furry is FeLV+ (Feline Leukemia Virus), which causes a weakened immune system and requires special care. APA! provides some medical assistance after adoption. Cats with FeLV typically have a shortened lifespan. Nick Furry is not contagious to people or dogs, but should live only with other FeLV+ cats. For more information, please contact APA! or read more by our Partner, Best Friends Animal Society: http://bestfriends.org/Resources/FAQs-About-Feline-Leukemia-Virus-FeLV All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Nick Furry please email [email protected]",

    "description": "Independent, Tiny, Quirky Although Rue is a fully-grown 1.5 year old kitty, she is so tiny that she still looks like a kitten! Her neck is so short that she reminds you of those egg-shaped Russian dolls. Her broken tail gives her an edgy, alley-cat vibe that is hilariously inconsistent with her otherwise adorable, lovable self. Her round little face is so cute that when she yawns, it will bring you to your knees. When you hold her like a baby, she\u0027ll look up at you with those huge eyes and you\u0027ll never want to put her down. This girl is the next cat-video star waiting to burst onto the scene! Rue still has that kittenish love of playing with anything and everything - toys, paper bags, her other foster cat buddy, whatever. When she plays, she plays full-out, but when the game is over, she\u0027s a total sunbather and couch potato. She is such a sweet, loving girl. She snuggles with her foster kitty buddy every night and licks him to sleep. If you\u0027re sitting or lying down anywhere, she\u0027ll be near you. She\u0027s not a lap cat and doesn\u0027t really enjoy being picked up and held, but she definitely loves to be petted and stroked - she can be initially shy, so just give her time. She\u0027s pretty quiet, and only meows when it\u0027s mealtime. Rue\u0027s ideal home would have another cat for her to play and cuddle. We haven\u0027t seen her with dogs or young kids, but think she might do best with no dogs and older, cat-savvy kids. If you are looking for an adorable, tiny, lovable perma-kitten, Rue might be perfect for you! Rue MeowClanahan is FeLV+ (Feline Leukemia Virus), which causes a weakened immune system and requires special care. APA! provides some medical assistance after adoption. Cats with FeLV typically have a shortened lifespan. Rue is not contagious to people or dogs, but should live only with other FeLV+ cats.

    "description": "Confident, playful, mischievous Hawkgirl and her litter were rescued as very sick kittens from a kill shelter in the middle of the night; it\u0027s rather miraculous that they made it out alive. Hawkgirl has been through a lot! And partly because of that, she has earned a special place in everyone\u0027s heart at APA! Besides being resilient and a survivor, Hawkgirl (who fittingly bears the name of a superhero), is affectionate and loves attention! She\u0027s chatty, and wants you to play with her. She\u0027s super-cuddly, and will purr up a storm when you pet her. But when the zoomies hit, she\u0027ll squirm away and run off to find a game. She is an adorable little ball of energy, and her favorite toys are jingle balls and catnip mice. She met a toddler and all went well with her and the little human! She is good with other cats, too, and likes to play and snuggle with them. She hasn\u0027t met any dogs, but given her friendly, playful nature, we think she\u0027d probably be fine with them. Hawkgirl would do best in an active home with people and furry playmates who will give her the love and attention she craves. She really does love being around others! To see more about Hawkgirl, visit these Facebook pages! https://www.facebook.com/youneedakitten/ https://www.facebook.com/NutterButtercat/ As one of Hawkgirl\u0027s many fans at APA! says, \"She is just TOO CUTE!!\" Contact us today to meet her. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Hawkgirl, please email us at [email protected]",

    "description": "Curious, Cautious, Precious Little Popcorn Pete is the smallest of his litter but wants to romp around with the big guys. They are always getting into mischief and public enemy number one is the toilet paper! After a full scale attack on the TP his brother will set off on another adventure but Pete retreats to the bathtub which is his favorite place to play. He is a little guy with big, curious eyes and a sweet personality. He is a little shy, especially around new people. He will let you hold him but he runs when you bend over to try and pick him up so you have to let him come to you. Pete would love to be in a home with a feline sibling to play with but doesn\u0027t seem like he would enjoy a canine friend or small children. He will need a home with patient humans who will let him get comfortable and find his way. Change throws him off a bit so he just needs to adjust and then he will be exploring his forever home....always with one eye out for the toilet paper!! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Relaxed, Easy-Going, Quiet In the hustle and bustle of life, sometimes you just want a mellow, uncomplicated, no-drama friend to hang out with. Wallace is that feline friend! He will cheerfully welcome your cuddling at any time, but won\u0027t follow you around to demand attention. He is content to lounge around and wait for an opening in your cuddling schedule! Wallace extends his good-natured behavior to other animals, both cats and dogs. He wants to be friends with other cats, but if he meets an unfriendly cat, he will retreat submissively and walk away in a relaxed, \"no worries!\" kind of way. Similarly, he wants to be friends with the dogs he has met, though he does prefer his canines on the quiet side; overly-active dogs that run towards him startle him. Otherwise, he easily shares space with dogs and has no problem approaching them when they are sitting or resting. What a great guy! Wallace is being treated for an non-contagious infection on his nose. He is a senior guy with a limp, though sometimes he will surprise you when he sprints and skips through the house! (No reason, just a burst of joyfulness he wanted to express.) He is friendly with kids, but since he is older, he\u0027s not the right playmate for children. He is supremely blissful when they pet him and treat him gently, though! Wallace likes to sit by a window and watch birds. He isn\u0027t interested in toys or climbing anything, but in his foster home there is a small, enclosed yard where he is allowed to go (always supervised!) - and he is excited to try and catch a bug. But that is short-lived, and then he is doing what he does best: napping and exuding complete satisfaction and fulfillment. Life is good! You might hear Wallace when it is time to eat and he discovers that his dish is empty, but that\u0027s about it. He is a low-maintenance cat that needs a quiet, low-traffic home. He enjoys peace, harmony, and a hushed environment! Having other animals with a similar personality to hang out with would suit him, too. Wallace takes \"content\" to a whole new level. Contact us today to meet this sweet boy! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "A Cloud Incarnate, Sweet, Calm Kip might have a short name but he\u0027s long on fluff! This cutie very well might just be made of a cloud and enjoys receiving any pets you have to give... In the name of collecting data, of course. He\u0027s not much of a lap cat, but loves to receive affection in any other form. Kip knows he\u0027s beautiful and can be a bit sassy, so he\u0027d be best suited to a house with older, cat-savvy children. A ferocious toy-mousy killer or a feather wand annihilator he is not - Kip\u0027s a cat that\u0027s perfectly happy to just hang out and watch the world go by. Kip isn\u0027t much of a fan of other cats - he\u0027ll tolerate another cat being near him, but will holler if he thinks they\u0027re invading his space. Said hollering is the only time this quiet boy feels the need to pipe up, so you know he means it! If his forever home contained another cat, you could expect a \"Craigslist roommates\" type situation - they live together peacefully, they use the same bathroom, but they\u0027re not really friends. Kip\u0027s perfect home would be one with a couple people to give him love and affection and just chill out. If you\u0027re looking for a fluffy buddy cat to keep you company, Kip just might be your man! Kip is FeLV+ (Feline Leukemia Virus), which causes a weakened immune system and requires special care. APA! provides some medical assistance after adoption. Cats with FeLV typically have a shortened lifespan. Kip is not contagious to people or dogs, but should live only with other FeLV+ cats. For more information, please contact APA! or read more by our Partner, Best Friends Animal Society: http://bestfriends.org/Resources/FAQs-About-Feline-Leukemia-Virus-FeLV All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip.

    "description": "Handsome, playful, timid Say hello to OJ! He\u0027s just learning to make human friends and he\u0027s showing promise! He doesn\u0027t like to be picked up, but he will approach you. For example, if you put food in your lap, he\u0027ll climb on up-at least until it\u0027s gone. He\u0027s very high energy and loves playing with his siblings (favorite game: tag). He also enjoys toys he can pick up, like the little fishing rod toy in his foster home. OJ hasn\u0027t met any dogs or kids. He\u0027s timid so he\u0027d probably do best in a home that\u0027s quiet and gentle. He\u0027d love to find a forever family who will help him with his social skills. He\u0027s got a lot of love to give, he just needs someone to make him feel comfortable enough to show it. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

She\u0027s especially fond of the fishing rod toy in her foster home and anything with streamers. She hasn\u0027t met any kids or dogs, but she\u0027d likely do best in a quiet, gentle forever home.

    "description": "Bear is an easy-going and social fellow! He gets along with everyone in his foster home, including a young child, adult cats, and a dog. His foster home includes an in-home business with a steady flow of clients, and sometimes Bear strolls in, says hello to everyone, lounges for a bit, then saunters off for a solitary nap. He seems to take life in stride, and happily finds a sunny window to perfect his chill! Bear is patient and calm with the young child in his foster home, allowing himself to be petted gently, if rather enthusiastically; he won\u0027t even twitch a whisker. He isn\u0027t demanding, but if you offer him a cuddle he will likely take you up on it! Bear takes half a pill twice a day for hyperthyroidism, something that is not unusual with older cats. But he is a super low-maintenance cat who sleeps through the night - and will sometimes sleep with you. We love how special Bear is! Contact us today if you have the special forever home just for him. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip.

She may decide all that exertion calls for a nap and proceed to fall asleep right then and there. At other times she\u0027ll make the descent back down to your lap, another place she loves to catch some zzzs! Her curiosity is insatiable and takes her to exotic places such as cabinets, closets, bookshelves and table tops. She\u0027s stealthy, no doubt, sometimes becoming \"lost\" to her foster family when she quietly hunkers down in one of her newly discovered locales. Honey prefers that you don\u0027t hold her, a girl has to be ready for action if the next escapade calls after all! But, cuddles and pets are certainly welcome. She can be shy at first, but that doesn\u0027t last for long. Honey hasn\u0027t had any interactions with kids or dogs. But, she enjoys spending time with her sweet brother, Fig, who often joins her for adventures inside mysterious cardboard boxes or endlessly fascinating bathtubs. You may also find them wrangling with strings, wand toys and on occasion, those alluring and sometimes alarming jingly balls! Honey has tested positive for Feline Leukemia (FeLV). It is possible for kittens six months and younger to shed this virus completely and test negative, so Honey will be re-tested for FeLV at his six month birthday, at which time a definitive diagnosis can be assured. Until then, Honey should live with no other cats or kittens to ensure the virus is not passed. Honey is available for adoption now to adopters who can accommodate a feline leukemia positive, or negative, cat as she is not yet of age to have a definitive test. For more information, please contact APA! or read more by our Partner, Best Friends Animal Society: http://bestfriends.org/Resources/FAQs-About-Feline-Leukemia-Virus-FeLV If you\u0027re looking for a playful kitten who is part mountain goat, part teddy bear and who has a good dose of Christopher Columbus (fluffy version) thrown in, then it may just be time to sweeten your world with precious Honey! Contact us to meet her today! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

He\u0027s living in a foster home with with lots of brothers and sisters, and he\u0027s definitely a popular kitten.

And don\u0027t worry about when it\u0027s time for pets -- Ron will definitely let you know with a sweet meow or three.

    "description": "Shy, Quiet, Autonomous Danny Boy is a guy who knows his own mind and what he likes. So he has one fundamental rule: he likes things on his own terms! He is a totally sweet guy, he just likes to stay above the fray. For example... Danny Boy is friendly and will greet you, welcoming some loving and petting! And when he is done, he will move on to something else; on his own terms. He doesn\u0027t seem to want to cuddle, but we think that might change once he is out of the shelter environment and in his own home. And Danny Boy is curious and playful, but - you guessed it! - on his own terms. He likes to play with jingly toys on his own, plus plays well with his favorite feline playmate (he basically ignores the other cats). He would probably be fine in a quiet home with another mellow cat, as long as he has his own space to retire to when he needs some alone time. Adults and older children who respect Danny Boy\u0027s space and time requirements would be the best human companions for him. To see more about Danny Boy and his friends, visit this Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/NutterButtercat/ Danny Boy is jet black and has super cool eyes! Contact us today to meet this handsome guy. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Playful, Lively, Fun Vetra is a total sweetheart! She purrs loudly and loves to cuddle at night. During the day she\u0027s sprightly, playing with toys and climbing all over her kitten condo. Vetra is fabulous with dogs and kiddos, so she would do well in a home with a cat-friendly canine. She hasn\u0027t spent time with other cats yet, but we imagine she would warm up to them quickly. Vetra has tested positive for Feline Leukemia (FeLV). It is possible for kittens six months and younger to shed this virus completely and test negative, so Vetra will be re-tested for FeLV at her six month birthday, at which time a definitive diagnosis can be assured. Until then, Vetra should live with no other cats or kittens to ensure the virus is not passed. Vetra is available for adoption now to adopters who can accommodate a feline leukemia positive, or negative, cat as she is not yet of age to have a definitive test. For more information, please contact APA! or read more by our Partner, Best Friends Animal Society:http://bestfriends.org/Resources/FAQs-About-Feline-Leukemia-Virus-FeLV All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip.

    "description": "Friendly, Affectionate, Cuddly Phoebe was born to love! Her favorite place is by your side or on top of you, with her purr engine rumbling away. And, while we\u0027re on the topic of purrs, Phoebe\u0027s can be heard clear across the room! She is social and people-friendly and will follow you from room to room, waiting for you to pick her up, hold her, and cuddle her. Or, if you\u0027re not paying attention to her, she may head-butt you and give a meow for emphasis; and if that doesn\u0027t work, she will rev up her aforementioned purr motor! In addition to loving people, she gets along well with other cats. She is patient and easy-going. We think she would do great in a home with gentle kids and nice cats - she plays well with both. And if you have a mellow, cat-friendly dog, she would probably be fine with him/her, too. Toss a ball or a toy, and Phoebe will chase it around the room! She is most energetic early in the day and after mealtime, but she sleeps quietly through the night. She has perfect litterbox manners and uses the designated scratching post. Phoebe\u0027s ideal home would include people to snuggle with and a cat buddy to play with. Contact us today to meet this affectionate girl with a sweet face and big paws - and an even bigger heart!

    "description": "Enthusiastic, Energetic, Determined Eeyore is one heck of a kitten. This little guy doesn\u0027t understand the meaning of doing something halfway - with Eeyore, it\u0027s 110%, 100% of the time! He plays like a fiend, sleeps like the dead, and even uses the litter box with fierce determination. He\u0027s incredibly outgoing and will immediately leap into any lap that presents itself. He also likes to climb on shoulders and perch there for awhile, because being a cat just isn\u0027t enough - Eeyore wants to be a parrot too! He loves affection and will receive all of your pets with gusto and give you merciless kisses, until he\u0027s off to prey on the helpless ribbons and toys in his vicinity. It doesn\u0027t matter if you\u0027re around to observe his dedication to playtime, as Eeyore can happily amuse himself, no problem. The only thing that Eeyore struggles with is balance. It turns out that this little potbellied cutie has cerebellar hypoplasia (more information below). His CH is moderate, so he wobbles, tips over, and flops around rather than moving in a straight line. His foster hasn\u0027t had to make any special accommodations for him - Eeyore\u0027s determined spirit means that no wobbliness is going to slow him down! The only thing he needs a little help with is bath time, since it can be a little tricky for him to reach certain spots. This is easily remedied by sporadic sponge baths, to keep Eeyore at his 110% cutest. Additionally, they\u0027ve been working on how to get safely off of the couch, as right now, Eeyore is prone to face-planting his way down (ouch!). With time, this should get easier for him as he learns how to get himself down, but a set of steps could also help. Eeyore\u0027s perfect home would be one with another cat (or any friendly animal!) around for him to play with - he misses his siblings! He\u0027s done well with the dog in his foster home (even sleeping on the dog\u0027s tail!) and his infectious joie de vivre has even started to win over the aloof cats in his foster home. The other cats have even started to play with him! In terms of children, a house with older kids would be best, to make sure that everyone understands that Eeyore is a little different from other cats. If you\u0027re looking for the pinnacle of indoor cats - one that will love you to pieces, pounce and tussle and play until the cows come home, stuff his little belly and then pass out on your pillow, dear wobbly Eeyore might just be the cat for you! Feline cerebellar hypoplasia is a non-progressive, non-contagious neurological condition that causes balance issues. CH cats were born like this and usually wobble or have a funny gait; some cats have a minor imbalance and some are very wobbly! Cats with minor to moderate CH require no special care, or only minor accommodation, like avoiding stairs. Cats adopted from APA! with CH must be kept indoors only. CH cats have the same lifespan as other cats. For more information, please visit: lifewithchcats.com. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Eeyore, please email [email protected]",

    "description": "Loving, Independent, Delightful Lady Liberty: resilient, constant, true. That\u0027s our gal! She is older, but has a loving spirit that is strong and shines through in everything she does. Kind of like a beacon in the dark. She is super sweet and affectionate, and will dedicate herself to following you around the house! When you take a break, she will sit at your feet and fall asleep. Sometimes she will cuddle with you at night, sometimes she decides to sleep in a cozy spot elsewhere in the house. She likes to exercise her independence! Previous to her stay with APA!, Lady Liberty had been declawed. As a result of this she must remain an indoor cat. She is calm and mild-mannered and will roam and explore the house, but doesn\u0027t seem interested in toys. She is relaxed around other pets, rather unconcerned about them, and has snuggled with the resident adult cat in her foster home! We think she would do great with older children who don\u0027t need her to be their playmate, but who will give her gentle loving. Lady Liberty is diagnosed with hyperthyroidism, and needs a diet that supports her aging kidneys. She will meow when she is hungry or thirsty, but otherwise is quiet (but will meow when you come home, she is so excited to see you!). Her ideal home would be calm; she may be happiest in a home as an only pet so that she can get ALL of the loving and attention that she deserves! Contact us today to meet Lady Liberty! She is a great companion. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Curious, playful, rambunctious Most of the time, when a family comes to APA! to add a furry new friend to the household, they can look forward to years of stuffed-mouse-swatting, feather-grabbing, ball-chasing feline hijinks and prolonged, purr-highlighted snuggles. And sadly, sometimes not. All the more reason to introduce you to a slinky, lanky, gorgeous gray tuxedo kitty named Unicorn, who can swat foil balls and bottle caps around with the best of them, who loves to gallop through the house looking for things to play with and wrestling with her fosters\u0027 other three cats, one of whom actually enjoys it. Unfortunately, Unicorn is also very sick. Her kidneys are failing, possibly due to something poisonous she ingested. She is likely to live less than a year, possibly just a few more months. We just don\u0027t know. Still, Unicorn gives every indication of making the most of whatever time she has left. Her curiosity seems boundless, even with strangers-definitely not scaredy-cat that hides out whenever the doorbell rings. And if someone happens to open a drawer, a box, a cabinet, a clothes dryer, she\u0027s all \"What\u0027s that? Lemme in! Lemme in!\" On Unicorn\u0027s down days, she\u0027s lethargic, won\u0027t play, can\u0027t eat. But when she\u0027s feeling healthy and frisky, she demonstrates it all the more by eating out of everyone\u0027s food bowls, including the one belonging to the household\u0027s older lab mix, who\u0027s also her favorite playmate. After a few minutes of food poaching, a low, only slightly threatening growl reminds her that she has her own food bowl to scamper back to. We realize it will take a very special family to adopt Unicorn, and not just because her illness will require her litter box to be changed more often than most. But because, like every APA! kitty we save, she deserves a secure, loving and happy forever home. However long forever may be. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

He lets you know when he wants a snuggle by softly patting your ankle and giving cute mews to get your attention. Touching him is like stroking silk, so soft and gentle, and activates his purr engine that just keeps chugging along. Shiloh will leap energetically after a mouse-on-a-stick toy, and afterwards will reward the person holding the stick with effusive head butts, licks, purrs, and little mews to show his appreciation!

    "description": "Beautiful - Shy - Energetic As evidenced by her portrait, Praline is a gorgeous white/torbie kitten with beautiful, anime-like golden eyes and a perfect, white-tipped tail. There\u0027s way more to Praline than her good looks, though. Formerly feral, Praline was found on the street and raised by a Good Samaritan until she was three months old, at which time she came to APA! She has been living in a pet-filled foster home, where she has developed perfect litter and scratching manners. She\u0027s also quiet as a mouse. Praline gets along very well with other cats, both her own littermates and the resident felines. She loves to play and has a ton of energy, whether she\u0027s pouncing on another kitten or batting around her toys. Praline will run around until she\u0027s exhausted and ready for a nap. There are two large resident dogs in Praline\u0027s foster home and she will tolerate them, but will run away if either move toward her, so she would prefer a dog-free forever home. She has not met any children, but since she prefers a calm, quiet environment, younger kids would probably not be a great fit. Praline can be shy and will sometimes run when approached, but she does enjoy being petted and scratched (especially under the chin). If you sneak up behind her and start petting, she is perfectly happy to stay in one place and receive affection. Praline also sleeps in her foster mom\u0027s bed at night, so it\u0027s likely that, in a quieter home with fewer animals, she will continue to come out of her shell. We think the ideal living situation for Praline would be a calm, relaxed household with one other friendly cat and loving and patient humans who want to help her blossom. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Playful, affectionate, adorable You know the famous banker character on your Monopoly game board? The one with the white, prominently upturned mustache? Well, it\u0027s a dead ringer for the one that rests under the schnozz of a kitty named Zinovia. It\u0027s impossible not to smile when you see this lovely, blue-and-white lady in all her mustachioed glory. Another thing that\u0027s sure to keep you smiling is Zinovia\u0027s penchant for sitting square on your lap and nose-booping you while she purrs non-stop. A full-throated, high-revving purr-nothing subtle about it. Zinovia is currently living with three resident cats she loves to play with-when they\u0027ll let her-and two frisky fosters who are more than happy to oblige. From wrestling and chasing one another to batting around any and all objects not firmly tied down. There\u0027s also a prodigiously proportioned pooch to play with, although Zinovia remains mostly aloof, not so much out of fear as lack of interest. After all, a girl needs some alone time for napping and just, you know, lounging around. Given Zinovia\u0027s playful nature, having her very own playmate to go along with her brand-new home would be a dream come true. So Zinovia would be honored if you\u0027d consider adopting her along with her favorite foster sibling whose name, coincidentally...is Honor. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

Check out this video of her playing with her fellow foster kitten buddies: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v\u003dTUiU9AgsDww. With talent like that, just give her a hockey stick and watch her bring home the Stanley Cup! Needless to say, Pawdry is a very active, athletic girl, so she needs a home with another cat or kitten who will want to PLAY! She enjoys playing with kids and loves to chase toys. As long as she gets in a good play workout morning and evening, she\u0027ll sleep through the night. Pawdry is as cuddly as she is athletic. She loves to be held by adults and by kids who are gentle with her. Her favorite post-workout routine is a good long cuddle session in your lap. She\u0027s curious and adventurous, and always wants to be where the action is. She squeaks for food and attention! She even has impeccable litter box and scratching manners, and she\u0027s fine with having her nails trimmed. Sounds pretty perfect, right?

    "description": "Curious - Playful - Shy This sweet boy in the tuxedo -- aptly named Tux -- loves to play with toys and chase his cat friends around the house. Playtime is his favorite time of day. With humans, he is sweetly purring, but is a little shy until he gets to know you. Sudden movements send him running from the room, but he\u0027ll soon be back for pets and playtime. Tux has the cutest habit of tilting his head to one side when he is curious about something. He will follow you around the house to see what you\u0027re up to! Tux loves to be petted but does not like to be chased or picked up. He wants to come to you, so older children who can respect that would be fine but small kids may not be the best choice. Tux loves other cats, and would do well in a household with another cat to pal around with. He has no experience with dogs. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Affectionate, Shy, Cuddly Easter is a classic tabby kitten looking for his forever home. You won\u0027t be able to resist his tummy spots and big sweet eyes! He is a bit shy at first and takes some time to warm up to strangers, but once he does he\u0027s quick with head-butts and rubbing against you, and you now have a friend for life! He adores snuggle time with sweet nuzzles into your neck and rubbing against you. You even have a personal hair stylist since Easter likes to groom your hair! Since he is a kitten, he loves to play with his foster mates, Kibble, Katnip and Kaleidoscope, and especially with string toys. He also loves to romp around on his cat tree. He is a pretty quiet kitty, but he is increasingly becoming more vocal to let you know when your attention is needed. He\u0027ll even be proactive with his dainty paw and reach out to you or climb up and search for the perfect spot in your lap. If you happen to have a phone or laptop there, he\u0027ll be glad to \"help\" you make use of it! Easter\u0027s ideal home would be with one of his foster mates or another playful kitty to keep him company. Two is better than one! If Easter and his friends sound like the perfect addition to your family, don\u0027t hesitate to meet them! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Easter, please email [email protected]",

    "description": "Playful - Energetic - Cuddly Ashley is a beautiful and extremely soft white kitten with gorgeous green eyes and a few strategically-placed splotches: a tiny black one on her nose and a charcoal gray one right on top of her head between her ears. Fortunately, she enjoys snuggling and sleeping next to her humans, so you\u0027ll be able to pet her soft coat often. While Ashley likes to cuddle, she loves to play - she can often be found running around and exploring her foster home. Ashley\u0027s favorite toys include feathers, squeaky toys, and the ever-popular laser pointer. But she doesn\u0027t want to only play by herself - she likes to have interactive play time with her favorite humans. Ashley isn\u0027t a particularly chatty cat, but she has an adorable chirp of a meow. And she definitely has a good purring engine. A kitten as sweet and well-rounded as Ashley would do well in almost any loving home, but the best-case scenario for her would involve plenty of room to explore and humans who can play and provide affection. She would likely enjoy being part of a house with cat-savvy kids who can keep up with her! Ashley has tested positive for Feline Leukemia (FeLV). It is possible for kittens six months and younger to shed this virus completely and test negative, so Ashley will be re-tested for FeLV at her six month birthday, at which time a definitive diagnosis can be assured. Until then, Ashley should live with no other cats or kittens to ensure the virus is not passed. Ashley is available for adoption now to adopters who can accommodate a feline leukemia positive, or negative, cat as she is not yet of age to have a definitive test. For more information, please contact APA! or read more by our Partner, Best Friends Animal Society: http://bestfriends.org/Resources/FAQs-About-Feline-Leukemia-Virus-FeLV All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip.

Stinka is still getting used to this whole \"domestic thing. She was found as a feral kitten and is currently being socialized. There is good news, though! Stinka loves her sister, Smelly Cat, and they enjoy playing together. Also, Stinka hasn\u0027t been destructive at all -- her patient foster\u0027s furniture and carpet remain unclawed. And to top it all off, Stinka is just plain adorable: a sweet little tabby with a cute white belly and paws. She\u0027s still young, too! With patience, time, and effort, this sassy cat could be the perfect prissy queen of your castle. Stinka would do best in a home without kids or dogs. If you\u0027re the type of human who likes to show scared kitties that they can trust other humans, then Stinka is just the cat for you.

Smelly Cat doesn\u0027t smell bad at all, but she can still be a little stinker sometimes. You see, she\u0027s just getting used to being indoors around humans. Her foster, who\u0027s socialized many feral kitties, says that she\u0027ll probably be a lover someday, though. She\u0027s got a ton of potential! If you\u0027re willing to put in the time and effort with ample patience, you\u0027re bound to fall in love. Smelly Cat also loves her foster sister, Stinka. They were both found as feral kittens, so they understand each other. And, even more good news: Smelly Cat is still young! There\u0027s plenty of time to teach her to trust and love a family. She\u0027s also pretty darn cute with that tabby splotch on her head. Smelly Cat would probably do best in a home with adults and older kids. She barely understands grown-ups, so kids would probably be pretty overwhelming. Ideally she\u0027d be the true queen of the castle, but she might do okay with other cats, maybe not so much dogs.

    "description": "Minotaur must be so-named because he seems to be part kitten and part human! He is a modern boy, and very interested in all devices that have a display: cell phone, iPad, TV. He sees that something is going on in there, and he wants to be a part of it, so he will launch himself at the screen! Super cute. Minotaur is a lover boy, too! He is happy to take a nap on your chest and to cuddle with you at night. He loves people and plays well with everyone. If you aren\u0027t around, he will cuddle sweetly with one of his sisters or engage in fun playtime - they are great together. His ideal home would definitely include a feline buddy. Minotaur is a food stealer! So far in his foster home, he has stolen his foster mom\u0027s hummus, pita chips, popcorn, cheese, soup (that was a tough one!), veggie burger, fruit, lettuce (who steals lettuce??), and pastries. So far! To see more about him, check him out on Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/cutestfosterkittensever/ Minotaur has tested positive for Feline Leukemia (FeLV). It is possible for kittens six months and younger to shed this virus completely and test negative, so he will be re-tested for FeLV at his six month birthday, at which time a definitive diagnosis can be assured. Until then, he should live with no other cats or kittens to ensure the virus is not passed. Minotaur is available for adoption now to adopters who can accommodate a feline leukemia positive, or negative, cat as he is not yet of age to have a definitive test.

    "description": "Playful, loving, rambunctious There are two words you seldom, if ever, expect to see in the same cat adoption biography. Those words are \"cuddler\" and \"aggressive.\" But according to the foster home currently enjoying the company of a striking gray tabby named Garrus (you heard right, Garrus) those words describe him perfectly. He is an aggressive cuddler. As soon as his foster enters the room, he is all over her, insinuating himself into an extended cuddle. He has also been known to lull his foster to sleep at night, then lick her nose wide awake in the morning hoping for more of the same. Garrus isn\u0027t a particularly hyper feline as these things go, until suddenly, for no apparent reason, he\u0027ll embark on a joyous spree, sprinting around the apartment, attacking innocent toys (mostly teaser and kicking toys), generally wearing himself out, and finally heading to the nearest sunny window for a nap. Curiously, for such a active and playful critter, Garrus isn\u0027t particularly vocal, producing tentative little meows when he\u0027s after food or love. Probably both. Garrus is suspicious of his foster\u0027s dog, but also curious. It\u0027s almost as if they\u0027d like to play together, but aren\u0027t quite sure how to go about it. Because he\u0027s so receptive to attention, he would probably do pretty well with kids. Cats, on the other hand, would need to be the type who enjoy being pounced upon. Lately, Garrus has been scratching his foster\u0027s rug, so getting him used to a scratching post has risen a bit higher on her list of things to do. Along with finding him the ideal forever home: one with a big window for sunning himself, plenty of room for running around, plenty of toys to play with, and, of course, plenty of love. Especially the aggressively cuddly kind. Garrus has tested positive for Feline Leukemia (FeLV). It is possible for kittens six months and older to shed this virus completely and test negative, so Garrus will be re-tested for FeLV at his six-month birthday, at which time a definitive diagnosis can be assured. Until then, Garrus should live with no other cats or kittens to ensure the virus in not passed. Garrus is available for adoption now to adopters who can accommodate a feline leukemia positive, or negative, cat as he is not yet of age to have a definitive test.

She will lay down anywhere to be next to her human friends, and she can sometimes get upset at night without a cuddle-buddy. She will purr just from being next to you. Point is, this girl loves to be with people. Don\u0027t let her chill-side fool you though, she also loves to PLAY! She is less fond of toys as she is climbing, jumping, and exploring her surroundings. She turns into an energy-force chasing after the laser pointer! Sissy likes to spend her days running and exploring. She is fun and smart, and during her household adventures she has even learned how to open doors! She is very active, but she likes to lay down and cuddle as soon as playtime is over - letting you play with her tiny toes that are delightfully different colors. Sissy is the perfect combo of energy, cuddly, and pretty - with a very unique red-tinted tabby coat. Contact us today to meet this cuddly lady. Sissy is FeLV+ (Feline Leukemia Virus), which causes a weakened immune system and requires special care. APA! provides some medical assistance after adoption.

He comes running when the door opens to be the first one to greet his human friends with lots of purrs and rubbing instantly making the day better and erasing all the stress of the outside world. He is a \"people cat\" and often leave his siblings\u0027 play to seek out humans for pets and snuggle time using soft head butts and paws to show his affection. Like his name sake Zorro, he uses his black panther like body to leap through the air after flying mice on sticks when playing with his human friends. His lap snuggling skills mixed with that train engine purr have been known to make humans spend an extra hour or two on the couch just for the joy of his company. \"Zorro the Lover\" gets better looking as he ages and will be a beautiful stately cat and an affectionate loving friend to his new family. There are many solid black kittens but \"Zorro\u0027s\" personality makes him extraordinary. Contact us today to meet amazing Zory!

    "description": "Scrappy, Sweet, Good-Hearted Walter was a formidable fighter in his heyday...he has numerous battle scars and a ragtag ear to prove it. But, now he\u0027s more into head rubs, than rumbles, and he\u0027ll take a sunshiny window for napping over a street fight any day. Walter is shy with new humans and you may even see a bit of bravado when you first meet him. Underneath it all is a gentle, sweetheart who wants reassurance that it\u0027s okay to trust. Once he does, Walter enjoys being petted and will appreciatively purr to let you know how good your kind attention makes him feel. He enjoys chasing feather toys from time to time, but, overall he prefers lounging to being active. Walter recently had his teeth removed to resolve his stomatitis, which is an inflammation of the mouth. He\u0027s been a bit of a grouch as he adjusts, but we know for sure there\u0027s a docile cat lurking inside. In fact, he was a lap cat and a major cuddler before he was surrendered and we\u0027re told he was a big fan of tummy rubs too. We would love to see that happy cat emerge again! Walter would do best in a home with a patient, loving person who will give him the time he needs to feel comfortable and safe. When he realizes you\u0027re in this for keeps and that he\u0027s finally found his forever, this former tough guy will be a total pussycat! If you\u0027re ready to transform Walter\u0027s uncertain world into a happy, secure one, contact us to meet him today! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

She won\u0027t actively seek you out, but if you put her on the couch next to you, she\u0027ll hang out and purr while you gently brush and pet her. But if you\u0027re busy, she\u0027s quite content to be left alone. She\u0027s usually very quiet, though she will occasionally charm you with her sweet, soft meow. Eva is tolerant of other cats, but doesn\u0027t seem interested in playing or interacting with them. She really just wants to chill out in a quiet, comfortable place! So if you\u0027re looking for a sweet, low-key kitty, Eva just might be the one for you! Eva has diabetes and requires some extra medical care, which may include regulated diet and/or insulin. For more information, please contact APA! Previous to her stay with APA! Eva had been declawed. As a result of this she must remain an indoor cat. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Resolute - Receptive - Chummy Torvald had a rough go of it before landing in his foster home - he was treated for an injury to his legs and pelvis. Fortunately, this handsome orange gentleman is on the mend and enjoying his new lease on life. He\u0027s had a lot of new experiences since joining his foster home, like being around the resident dogs (he mostly ignores them but sometimes hisses) and resident cats (he can be a little bit bossy). While he\u0027s learning to take things in stride, Torvald will likely require a slow introduction to any other pets. He might be a little defensive or aggressive at first. However, Torvald certainly seems to love people - he\u0027s quite chatty and likes to follow you around. He was recently triple-teamed by a group of feline-loving 8-year-olds and thoroughly enjoyed the attention. Torvald loves flopping down on any soft, welcoming surface he can find and likes to just hang out. He\u0027s not bursting with crazy cat energy and doesn\u0027t seem super interested in toys, so if you\u0027re looking for a laidback cat who likes to talk, Torvald\u0027s your man! Torvald is a healthy FIV+ (Feline Immunodeficiency Virus) cat. FIV+ cats typically live long, healthy lives!

And once he\u0027s in your lap, he loves to have his little black and white face rubbed while purring away in your ear. The markings on his little face might make him look serious, but he\u0027s seriously a real joy! Katnip likes to talk to you when he wants attention - to be petted, stroked, picked up, played with - any of those will do for him! If you are sitting down, he will perform the aforementioned purring-in-your-ear thing and then flop down in your lap. If you are lying down, you instantly become his new favorite cat bed! While he hasn\u0027t had much experience with dogs or children, Katnip sure does love the attention from other kitties, so he would do best in a home where he can socialize. If you\u0027re looking for a cutie who loves to cuddle as much as he loves to play, Katnip is just the kitten for you!

    "description": "Playful, energetic, sweet Her name is not an accurate description of this sweet girl!! (see definition if interested: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolpertinger). She is a cat with a great balance of independence but wanting to be present, playful and cuddly. She maintains great eye contact and will give you a meow when she is happy. She is a little shy at first but once she is comfortable she will jump on your lap and fall fast asleep. She will approach for petting and ear scratches. She likes to be your little shadow but is not needy. She has been described as \"the sweetest lap cat ever\" by one of our adoption counselors and those folks know LOTS of cats! Wolpertinger loves wand toys, and laser pointers! She really likes to get up on an elevated surface so she can get a full view of her surroundings and she loves to run and jump around like crazy!! She has beautiful green eyes and the softest fur! Her markings are really unique - she has an orange nose and an orange stripe across her chest which really stands out against her predominantly jet black coat. One thing she isn\u0027t so fond of is other cats. She has made eye contact with other cats in her current location and freezes in her tracks. Other cats around her seems to stress her out so she needs to be the only feline in the home. She would probably feel the same about canine siblings - this gal would be best as the sole pet and queen of your world! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Wolpertinger, please email [email protected]",

    "description": "Shy, Small, Hungry Xavier has had a rough go of it. He was hit by a car before finding his foster home so he is understandably a bit traumatized. Despite his rough past, he is making great strides in foster. He used to hide and deny affection but after only 2 weeks he is out of hiding and will even accept head pets. Xavier isn\u0027t exactly social, but he is tolerant of just about everything. He tolerates other cats and dogs as long as they don\u0027t invade his space. He isn\u0027t crazy about play time because some toys frighten him. Xavier is happiest when curled up for a cat nap or when he\u0027s eating - like most cats! That being said, his ideal home would be pretty laid-back and willing to let him do his own thing. With some patience and love, Xavier will be on his way to being an excellent house kitty.

    "description": "As fast as a speeding kitten, able to climb the scratching post in a single try, it\u0027s Super Kitten! Or should we say, Super Ermine! Ermine is one amazing boy...when he was just 3 days old he and his brother, Elliot, came to live in the bottle baby nursery. Two days later they were whisked away to a foster home where they\u0027ve grown and thrived ever since! As soon as his eyes were open and he could see the world around him, Ermine\u0027s vibrant personality began to emerge...a bold adventurer who likes to run and explore followed by a gentle lovebug full of cuddles and purrs! Ermine loves wrestling with his brother and you may just find him proudly carrying around small feathers during playtime. He happily plays with his foster mom, but can also entertain himself with kitty toys. Ermine has been showered with human cuddles and kisses his entire life and is very tolerant of being picked up and loved on, even in the middle of active play! He has not had any experience with dogs or small children. But, he has been around his foster family\u0027s resident cats and tween aged kids. Ermine has excellent litterbox manners and is an all around wonderful kitty! If he could find his forever home, and better yet, find one that will include his sweet brother Elliot, life would sure be grand! If you\u0027re ready to play, cuddle and love contact us to set up a meet and greet today! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Ermine, please email [email protected]",

When he looks up at you with his huge eyes and cute heart shaped face and lets out a little mew, there is no way you can deny him cuddles and lots of kisses! When Elliot was just 3 days old he and his brother Ermine came to live in the bottle baby nursery. Two days later they were whisked away to a foster home where they\u0027ve grown and thrived ever since! Elliot is an affectionate kitty who will follow you around from room to room and who can hardly wait to be cuddled in your arms. He likes furry hugs too and snuggles regularly with his much adored brother, Ermine. Ermine\u0027s outgoing personality is the perfect balance to Elliot\u0027s more reserved temperament. When Ermine encourages Elliot to play, those two have a good ol\u0027 time! Excellent litterbox manners are also one of Elliot\u0027s many charms. The ideal household for Elliot would be on the quiet, calmer side and would include his brother and best friend, Ermine. If you have cuddles, kisses and lots of love to give, contact us to set up a meet and greet today! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip.

    "description": "Shy, sweet, lovable As fun and interesting as it might be to have a Nene (the official state bird of Hawaii, pronounced \"nay-nay\") as a pet, we\u0027re sure you\u0027d be a lot happier (and more environmentally conscious) with our little namesake. Our Nene has a beautiful black and white coat, a distinctive black splash of a nose and long white hairs sprouting randomly from her black markings. The largest of three siblings, Nene was under the weather for while, and as a result she\u0027s still quite shy and less active than she might normally be. She\u0027s been contenting herself mostly with snuggling down in her favorite spot and watching the other household cats play. From the security of her bed she started batting at a fleece string toy and soft fuzzy balls tossed her way. And lately, Nene\u0027s even begun to venture tentatively from her spot to explore and interact with her feline housemates. You get the feeling she\u0027s just waiting for her moment to shine. Perhaps it\u0027ll be a moment you\u0027d like to share with her in the quiet and loving security of your home. We certainly hope so. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Sweet, diminutive, playful It\u0027s true that GoGo isn\u0027t all that long out of her kitten stage, but she seems to be in very little hurry to kiss those halcyon days goodbye. The smallest of her litter, this black and white fluffball remains on the diminutive side, so much so that the picture of her scampering about the house on her tiny little feet is sure to become the officially accepted definition of cute. String toys, the usual feline favorite, haven\u0027t interested GoGo so far. But fuzzy-ball batting sessions, accompanied by her unique vocalizations, delight her no end. Socially, GoGo is as content to snuggle up with other cats in the house (don\u0027t know about dogs yet) as she is with its two-legged critters, young and old alike. After some initial shyness, up your leg she scampers (cute, cute, cute), politely requesting to be loved, petted, skritched, cosseted and otherwise doted upon. Satisfied by the much-deserved attention, GoGo is then free to dismount the chosen lap and resume her most important task: exploring uncharted territory around the corner, up the stairs, behind the drapes, inside the closet, under the bed. Just imagine how fascinating GoGo would find your corners, your stairs, your drapes, your closets, your bed. And, of course, you. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information, or to meet GoGo, please email [email protected]",

    "description": "Friendly, Playful, Adventurer Jojo is an inquisitive cat who loves to explore and discover new things. When she isn\u0027t finding new adventures, she craves attention from her human companions in the form of snuggles and head rubs. Jojo is one spunky girl who can find a toy in anything, but she loves a good game of swat the string. Jojo also enjoys chatting and greets her humans when they come in the door for playtime or nose boops. Jojo has the sweetest face with a cute fuzzy white belly! It\u0027s easy to see why she is the center of attention. Her activity level and desire to be around people make her one of a kind, which means she needs a household that lets her roam, play, and explore. Since she is also so vocal she fits best in households that will welcome her conversations. She hasn\u0027t been around dogs, but loves to snuggle up with her brothers and sisters after a long play session. If you\u0027re looking for a spunky, snuggly cat with a fun sense of adventure, contact us to meet your new best friend, Jojo. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Cheerful Affectionate Explorer Griffin is a cheerful and very playful girl who was evacuated from a Houston shelter before Harvey hit. It took her a couple of weeks to feel comfortable in her foster home, but once she settled in, she became very active and adventurous. She\u0027s already best buds with the foster\u0027s older cat. They play and nap together, groom each other, and share their food. Griffin loves her scratching post, cat nip, and toy balls - especially the ones that make noise. She\u0027ll play all night long, roaming and chasing imaginary prey. Griffin is more about playing than about petting, but she\u0027s comfortable being held, and she\u0027ll cuddle with you if you\u0027re lounging on the sofa watching TV. She\u0027s not super-vocal, but she does have a cute, soft little meow that she uses to remind you that it\u0027s mealtime. Griffin would do best in a home with lots of toys and a furry playmate. She will keep her family well-entertained with her antics! Griffin is FeLV+ (Feline Leukemia Virus), which causes a weakened immune system and requires special care. APA! provides some medical assistance after adoption. Cats with FeLV typically have a shortened lifespan. Griffin is not contagious to people or dogs, but should live only with other FeLV+ cats. For more information, please contact APA! or read more by our Partner, Best Friends Animal Society: http://bestfriends.org/Resources/FAQs-About-Feline-Leukemia-Virus-FeLV All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip.

Because he\u0027s been sick, he kept to himself but never turned down a good cuddle session. His calm and quiet nature soothes his other kitten friends, too -- they all love to head butt and snuggle with him. If you\u0027re patient and gentle, he\u0027ll happily curl up in your lap and enjoy a quiet nap. There are promising signs of the playful kitty inside of Tolstoy, too. He\u0027s been batting at toys more and more with each passing day as he starts his new life. And seeing those white socks in action sure is adorable! Tolstoy would do best in a home with no dogs, with a family who\u0027s patient and willing to give him the gentle care he needs while he grows big and strong. Once you stare into those beautiful green eyes, though, you\u0027ll fall in love with the kind soul behind them.

He came to us as a stray along with his sister, Liberty, and they are a pair that needs a good, safe home to call their own.

The way to this guys heart may be through his tummy! He has shows a great love of canned food containing any type of fish or seafood and gets closest to humans when being fed. He is not fond of any other cats but his sister, Liberty, and they would both very much like to stay together. They have been each other\u0027s rock and only constant.

    "description": "Outgoing, playful, amazing Introducing Hydra!! This sweet fella had a rough road in his first few months of life but is now getting his chance to be a kitten and is LOVING IT!! Hydra had been in a cage since he was two months old. Only recently, when he came to Austin Pets Alive! did he discover the joys of being free - but you\u0027d never know it by looking at him! He\u0027s amazing, sweet, and perfect, and immediately made himself at home in the APA! Feline Leukemia (FeLV) center. Now he is in a foster home where he has even more space to explore and he\u0027s so stoked on life, having all this room to run around in! Hydra LOVES to play!! Like really REALLY loves to play! Who can blame him? Now that he has the room to roam, it\u0027s playtime all the time. He\u0027s the kind of dude who wants to play until he\u0027s tired and THEN he will snuggle with you! And did we mention how handsome he is? What a looker!! He has those sweet eyes and the perfect symmetrical markings on his forehead. His stripes are so beautiful! Just look at the photos? That is a kitty who is loving life and is irresistibly adorable!! So what would Hydra\u0027s ideal home be? Somewhere with LOTS of love, attention, and affection! Maybe with some kids to keep him busy. He hasn\u0027t met any dogs that we are aware of but all indications are he would be happy with a canine sibling. He needs and deserves a home where he will receive - and where he will be able to give - endless amounts of entertainment and LOVE! Hydra has tested positive for Feline Leukemia (FeLV). It is possible for kittens six months and younger to shed this virus completely and test negative, so Hydra will be re-tested for FeLV at his six month birthday, at which time a definitive diagnosis can be assured. Until then, Hydra should live with no other cats or kittens to ensure the virus is not passed. Hydra is available for adoption now to adopters who can accommodate a feline leukemia positive, or negative, cat as he is not yet of age to have a definitive test. For more information, please contact APA! or read more by our Partner, Best Friends Animal Society: http://bestfriends.org/Resources/FAQs-About-Feline-Leukemia-Virus-FeLV All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Hydra, please email [email protected]",

He gives a big greeting to all the humans who enter his current digs and will follow and watch you intently. He loves being around people!! In addition to loving people, he loves his enclosure mates as well and is always chasing them around. He is a playful fella who likes any type of toy but playing with a friend is his favorite!!

    "description": "Sweet, quiet, playful We don\u0027t often (or ever, for that matter) have the honor of introducing a cat called...well...Honor. Yep, that\u0027s this gorgeous, dilute gray-and-white torbie\u0027s actual name. Honor. Or if you want to get all British-y about it, the Right Honorable Honor. Sadly, Honor came to us as a very ill neonatal kitten with an extremely poor prognosis. But happily, the APA! staff and volunteers pitched in to do what they\u0027re so good at doing and nursed her back to health. Which she is now thoroughly enjoying in her foster home. It\u0027s delightful to watch this fluffy sweetheart as she transitions from roughhousing with her foster siblings to batting balls and small toys from one end of the house to the other, carefully skirting her foster\u0027s 80-pound pit mix, whose jingling dog tags seem to spook her a bit. But it won\u0027t take her long to realize he\u0027s just a big, lovable lug. Equal parts playful and lazy, Honor prefers to lurk behind the scenes, observing things from a distance, until, summoning all her energy, she strolls out, all sweet and gentle, to snuggle next to you on the couch and have her belly rubbed. She\u0027s a sly one, her name notwithstanding. Purring seems to be Honor\u0027s preferred noise making device. But \"super quiet, like a ninja,\" says her foster. And although Honor displays no fear of specific loud noises like vacuum cleaners and blenders, a quiet, mellow home without a lot of activity would probably suit her best. Another cat in the household would also be nice. Or, even better, a playmate of her very own like her favorite foster sibling, the exotically-named Zinovia. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information, or to meet Honor (and Zinovia?), please email [email protected]",

    "description": "Friendly, energetic, playful This handsome, big-eyed tabby\u0027s name is Napoli. He loves to play so much that he is the absolute definition of outgoing! You\u0027ll always find him chasing and play-wrestling with other cats. Even when the other cat gets tired of playing, Napoli keeps pouncing on them! This ball of energy also loves to play with absolutely anything he can get his hands on - toy mice, little balls with bells, feathers, even wicker furniture lying around - you name it. Simply put, if you\u0027re looking for a cat with an endless supply of energy, this one will give the others a run for their money! Not only does Napoli adore playing, but he is extremely friendly with everyone he meets. Anytime he sees you, Napoli will come immediately running to follow you around! Don\u0027t worry if you aren\u0027t in his line of sight, all you have to do is call his name, and he\u0027ll come running! He\u0027s a very curious cat and always wants to know what you\u0027re up to. Napoli is also quite talkative. He loves to purr when you pick him up and also chirp and chatter, especially when you leave the room. An ideal home for Napoli would be one where he has lots of space to run around in and one with lots of toys for him to play with. This energetic boy would love an owner who has time to play with him, and another cat, or even possibly a gentle dog, to wrestle with! Napoli is an extremely resilient fella who has overcome many challenges. In fact, he is one of hundreds of cats and kittens that APA! has rescued from the perils of Hurricane Harvey. Most of these kitties are up for adoption and in need of a forever home. The greatest result of a rescue is the creation of loving relationships. Share in this joy with us and adopt a cat or kitten and create your own rescue love story! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip.

She loves to run around the house with a toy in her mouth, but once another cat starts eyeing that toy and approaching her, Cersei might let out a little growl to let them know she\u0027s not giving it up! When she\u0027s not playing, Cersei is very affectionate, and she\u0027ll seek out your lap asking for pets and snuggles. She\u0027s also a beautiful cat, who has pretty striped gray and white fur. Despite her protective nature when it comes to toys, Cersei loves her kitty siblings, but she hasn\u0027t been introduced to dogs or kids yet.

    "description": "Crisscross is the tiniest kitten in his litter, but his small size just makes it even easier for him to climb up onto your shoulder for a little ride, one of his favorite activities! He\u0027s also the only boy in his litter, but that doesn\u0027t make him any less affectionate; he loves cuddling and crawling into the nearest lap for a cat nap. He\u0027s also fine around other cats, but hasn\u0027t met any dogs or kids yet. Crisscross is a very handsome kitten with gray and white fur and the cutest markings that make it look like he has a little gray mustache and goatee! He is still working on gaining weight (he survived panleukopenia, and is getting supplemental food to help him grow big and strong), so he will need lots of love and attention from his adopter to help him feel better all around. Crisscross came from a kill shelter in Houston right before the Hurricane Harvey hit, so he is very fortunate to have the chance to find his perfect forever home where he\u0027ll receive plenty of cuddles! Crisscross is one of hundreds of cats and kittens that APA! has rescued from the perils of Hurricane Harvey. Most of these kitties are up for adoption and in need of a forever home. The greatest result of a rescue is the creation of loving relationships. Share in this joy with us and adopt a cat or kitten and create your own rescue love story! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Crisscross, please email [email protected]",

    "description": "Pretty, Fearful, Coming-Around Eclipse isn\u0027t the type to jump into your lap for cuddles or run across the room to greet you when you walk in the door. But, does she want love? Oh yes. She came to us from Houston where she was on the euthanasia list simply because she had an upper respiratory infection. She\u0027s also a young mother who recently finished raising her kittens. What she\u0027s been through is certainly enough to put anyone on edge and to make them feel leery of the world. But, kindness and patience have revealed that inside this very scared kitty is a hopeful spirit who enjoys having her soft coat stroked and who is trying her best to learn to trust. Eclipse has gone from spending her days hiding under the bed and hissing at unwanted attention to allowing, and clearly enjoying, being petted...her sweet purr is evidence of that. She may add a nip to a petting session if you pet her near her mouth, but, it\u0027s playful and not aggressive. She doesn\u0027t lash out when she\u0027s upset or nervous. In fact, she\u0027ll let you pick her up without trying to bite or scratch you even though she doesn\u0027t like being held. Eclipse has a beautiful gray tabby coat and her pretty face resembles a proud cougar. With reassurance that there\u0027s no need to be frightened any longer, she is experiencing a comfort level and purr-worthy moments that she most likely has never known before. Now we\u0027d love for her to continue this enlightening journey in a forever home of her very own. If you would like to be the person who helps Eclipse further discover that life doesn\u0027t have to be lived alone or afraid, and that getting beyond a disturbing past can result in a beautiful future, contact us to meet this lovely lady today. Eclipse is one of hundreds of cats and kittens that APA! has rescued from the perils of Hurricane Harvey. Most of these kitties are up for adoption and in need of a forever home. The greatest result of a rescue is the creation of loving relationships. Share in this joy with us and adopt a cat or kitten and create your own rescue love story!

    "description": "Clever, Attentive, Playful At first glance you might think Missouri is your basic black cat; but look closely, and you will see that she is the darkest of browns, some black, some orange, perhaps some stripes in there...her coloring is rich and exotic! But as a kitten, Missouri wastes no time on her beauty - she wants to play! She bounces all over the place, squirming and wiggling with excitement. She bats a ball around; waits, carefully watching her \"prey\"; then pounces on it! She is entertaining and fun.

    "description": "How such loud purring can come out of such a tiny kitten we\u0027ll never know! Kendall is constantly purring, and he isn\u0027t shy about sharing his emotions. If he\u0027s hungry or wants attention, Kendall will make sure he\u0027s heard with his loud meows. Kendall loves people and will want to get as close to your face and neck as he can! He\u0027s a cuddly kitten who loves to nuzzle his head against your face or in your hair, and he\u0027s particularly fond of draping himself around necks and sucking on earlobes. A handsome brown striped and white kitty, he makes a very attractive and snuggly accessory! After being rescued from Hurricane Harvey, Kendall came to the Neonatal Nursery, where he was thought to to have been a little \"preemie\". Despite the loud purring and meowing he\u0027s capable of, Kendall is super tiny in size and will probably grow up to be a small cat. When he moved to his foster home, he was a full week younger than his foster siblings, who played a little too rough with him, so while he likes to play with other kittens, he prefers more gentle playing. If you\u0027re looking for a super social kitty who loves to be affectionate with his people, Kendall just might be the purrfect match! Kendall is one of hundreds of cats and kittens that APA! has rescued from the perils of Hurricane Harvey. Most of these kitties are up for adoption and in need of a forever home. The greatest result of a rescue is the creation of loving relationships. Share in this joy with us and adopt a cat or kitten and create your own rescue love story! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Lorraine is all about snuggles! Her perfect day would consist of leisurely laying in your arms while getting belly rubs. She\u0027s also perfectly happy curled up in a box with a soft blankie...so comfy! Lorraine is a people oriented kitty who prefers hanging out with humans over spending time with other animals. But she\u0027s figuring how to live harmoniously with the animals in her foster home.She has learned a girl sometimes has to stand up for herself and doesn\u0027t take any gruff from the other kitten there. And, while she initially found the dogs in her foster home a bit disdainful, she now just ignores them. Such a smart approach! Lorraine did very well with a four year old she recently met and would likely get along splendidly with respectful children. If you\u0027re looking for a lovebug who is always ready and willing to spend cozy times with her humans, contact us to meet Lorraine today!

    "description": "Shy, friendly, silly Falcor, a handsome kitty with a shiny black coat and big, bright eyes, does not particularly resemble Falkor, the flying luckdragon from \"The Neverending Story,\" who is white, wise, and can, well...fly. On the other hand, our Falcor does share an important trait with Falkor-with-a-k. After some intitial shyness, he\u0027s the friendliest feline you could ever wish for. Which is ironic, because he was thought to be a stray feral from a shelter in Houston before the Hurricane Harvey. But when he was placed in a kennel, he rolled right over for a belly rub. Feral indeed! With humans he knows, his shameless solicitation of aggressive petting, belly rubbing, chin chucking and ear skritching is a wonder to behold. But if he doesn\u0027t know you, he\u0027ll hide out until you can get properly acquainted. Falcor is not what you would call a highly active cat, prefering to look out the window or explore the house during his valuable free time. And as far as his foster can tell, he\u0027s not especially toy crazy. Just plain crazy is more like it. Why? After he finishes a meal he tries to cover it up, as a person might cover their plate with a napkin. He\u0027s done it after almost every canned food meal he\u0027s eaten. A quiet home without a lot of visitors woud be ideal for Falcor. Another mellow cat and a nice, calm dog who respect boundaries, would probably be okay. Because of his natural shyness, he will very likely play hide-and-please-don\u0027t-seek for several days days as he adjusts to his new surroundings and new people. But, as his foster lovingly describes the experience, he is \"totally worth the wait.\" All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information, or to meet Falcor, please email [email protected]",

    "description": "Quint, be still my heart! What a handsome orange tabby with electric eyes. Plus, he has a super loud purr motor - simply pick him up or lovingly touch him, and it will sound like NASCAR is in your living room! When Quint hears something in the other room or stumbles across something interesting as he curiously explores the house, he has a cute surprise reaction! Then he boldly investigates. When Quint was an itty-bitty-kitty in the APA! nursery (his eyes weren\u0027t even open yet), you always knew when he was awake, because he was LOUD. It was mystifying how someone so small could make so much noise! So it\u0027s fitting that now that he has grown up a bit, he has a loud purr. (And thankfully, his meow has not grown with his physical size!) Quint is growing up around adults, kids, and dogs in his foster home, and he interacts well with all of them. Contact us today to meet this kitten - he will make your heart go pitter-patter! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Quint, please email [email protected]",

    "description": "Roosevelt is the only girl in her litter but she is definitely the boss! She is sweet and outgoing and makes friends with everyone. She and her brother\u0027s love adventures and she is usually the one leading the way. She has the sweetest little gray nose that matches her fur with bits of pink to match her personality. Roosevelt is a playful girl, but more than anything, she is a lover. One of her favorite things to do is to sit on a shoulder and nuzzle your neck. Because of her bold nature, Roosevelt would fit best in a home that allows her to explore her environment and give her lots of snuggles when she\u0027s ready to relax. She would also enjoy other cats to play with... and especially go on adventures with. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip.

    "description": "Serene, Loving, Curious If you\u0027re looking for a laid back orangey delight who is always up for cuddles, Duke will do ya right! This super mellow tabby can often be found snuggling up in his cozy bed, chilling out and taking it all in. He gets along well with all of his kitty roommates and will intently watch them play as he relaxes on the sidelines. He\u0027s very curious about toys, so it may just be a matter of time before he joins in on the fun. He takes real pleasure in a nice head scratch and is such a quiet, easy-going boy, he\u0027d do well in most any household. Duke is one of hundreds of cats and kittens that APA! has rescued from the peril of Hurricane Harvey. Most of these kitties are up for adoption and in need of a forever home. That\u0027s why for the month of October, adoption fees will be waived on all APA! cats and kittens. This includes kitties of every age, in foster and at every adoption location. Feel like adding some furry, purry Zen to your world? Duke is happy to show you the way! Come by and meet him today! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

She is also super food driven and will love you for bringing her food...and treats. Golden Grahams is an inquisitive girl who finds dogs curious. Her independent spirit makes her cautious around them, though. She is a sweet girl who is still learning how to socialize, so she is best suited for a single pet household where she can warm up to people and be queen of the castle. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Affectionate, beautiful, introverted Fruity Pebbles is a Harvey rescue who came to one of our foster homes with her fellow rescue kitten buddy Gorgonzola. At first she was so scared that she didn\u0027t come out of the bathroom cabinet drawers for days! She even had to be fed in there. But once she realized that she is safe now, she became SO affectionate and playful! She loves to climb all over you, purring loudly. She\u0027s super-soft, so you\u0027ll really love petting and cuddling her! She plays with balls, wands and cat tunnels. She also loves chasing laser pointers and playing with Gorgonzola. Like most young kitties, she has a LOT of energy and likes to race around, play, and walk all over your lap. She also gives you head butts to get your attention. Fruity Pebbles hasn\u0027t yet met her foster\u0027s kids and cats, but is happy to hang out with their dog. She\u0027s still a bit skittish of anything new, so any introductions to kids and other pets should be made slowly. She does love her kitten friend Gorgonzola, though - they groom each other and sleep curled up together. Fruity Pebbles needs a home with people who are prepared to take the time to earn her trust, and make her feel safe. This doesn\u0027t mean it needs to be a one-person, one-cat quiet home (although she\u0027d probably love being the center of attention!) - she may thrive in a house with other pets or children, but it\u0027s important to know that she needs time to \"open up\". All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

It\u0027s easy to stare right back with those sweet baby blues she flashes too! Like most Siamese, Brie might be a tad bid cross-eyed. However, we think it just adds to this little cutie\u0027s endearing nature. Brie is also a recent mommy, and it\u0027s sure brought out her maternal side. Brie seems to be gleaming with love when she\u0027s around her babies. She adores her kittens and is particularly fond of the littlest kitten in her litter, Gouda. She will cuddle and clean little Gouda, and even play with him too. Talk about a fabulous cat mommy! Brie would love a home for herself, and if you\u0027ve got room in your heart- her little boy Cheddar too! She absolutely adores being around children and does very well with other pets. Brie is more on the calm side, so she doesn\u0027t require a whole lot of play time. She\u0027s more interested in cuddling and being held. She\u0027s sweet with cross eyes, but always by your side. She\u0027s the Mommy with the most- It\u0027s Brie. See more of Cheddar here: https://www.austinpetsalive.org/adopt/available-cat-details/?ID\u003d51580 Contact us today to meet Brie!

His favorite things are gobbling down wet food, zooming around the room like his tail\u0027s on fire, and pouncing on anything that comes within range.

So far he\u0027s met other cats and a dog and has had positive experiences, which means he\u0027d probably be fine with a house with other animals around. He and his brother were evacuated with their mom from a shelter on the coast before Hurricane Harvey hit, to bring them to safety and to clear up staging areas for local animals found after the storm.

    "description": "Chatty, Sociable, Independent Mao lost her forever home when her owner moved and couldn\u0027t take her along. She is used to being an only cat and doesn\u0027t care for another cat in her space - and will hiss to tell them so! However, she\u0027s not aggressive, so it is possible that over time she could learn to live with a mellow cat who would allow her to be the Boss of Them. It\u0027s a role she is used to, has perfected, and fits her to a t! Once Mao gets through the getting-to-know-you period, she will be super friendly! She seems never to be at a loss for words, and will talk to you about everything - in fact, she can be kind of a goofball as she flops on the floor near you for some petting, meowing (Mao-ing?) up a storm; she has some boundaries about where she likes to be petted, but they are easily learned and navigated. During downtime she becomes your snuggle buddy - and will let you pet her tummy, once she has decided that you do it correctly! We think she would be the perfect companion for someone who works from home or has a schedule that allows them to be home more often. She likes to hang out with her people! Mao is great with cardboard scratchers and will give crinkle balls and catnip toys a run for their money! Her current favorite toy is a blue fuzzy ball that she chases around the house. And watching birds from a sunny window is a great sport for her, too. Otherwise, she is content to find a safe spot to nap where she can keep an eye on everything going on. The ideal home for Mao would be quiet and orderly; she will be jumpy in a new environment for a while, but eventually she will settle in. Have patience, give her time, and she will reward you with her cuddles and companionship. She may be okay around a calm dog who completely ignores her, and prefers her humans as adults or older kids who know how to respect her boundaries, petting and playing with her appropriately. Mao isn\u0027t just an orange tabby female - which in itself is rather uncommon, since only about 20% of orange tabbies are female - she has scrumptious, Dreamsicle-like coloring and pretty facial features! We love Mao! Contact us today to meet her. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Sweet, Shy, Gentle When Coco Puff and her siblings arrived from Houston right before Harvey made landfall, they were in sad shape. They had bad colds, were unsettled, and their fur was dirty - clearly, they had been through a lot already! Their caretakers in the APA! Nursery were cautious when they went to handle Coco Puff for the first time - it was obvious that she didn\u0027t feel well, she had a piece of debris stuck on her nose, and she just wanted to curl into a small ball in the corner of her kennel and be left alone. But she couldn\u0027t have been more cooperative and appreciative! She loved being handled, and immediately arched her back for more petting, and when they started to clean her fur with a warm towel - she started up her purr motor! Under all that was a sweet and beautiful Siamese girl. Now, in her foster home, Coco Puff has grown into a sweet, docile gal. She\u0027s a bit shy and easily spooked, so she\u0027d likely do best in a single pet home with no children. Coco Puff is one of hundreds of cats and kittens that APA! has rescued from the perils of Hurricane Harvey. Most of these kitties are up for adoption and in need of a forever home. The greatest result of a rescue is the creation of loving relationships. Share in this joy with us and adopt a cat or kitten and create your own rescue love story! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Ugandi is the wild child of her family! This girl can get some serious air: whether leaping off her cat condo like a BASE jumper or springing out behind a corner to surprise you, she is an athlete with a mischievous streak! Ugandi rarely wants to sit still; she would much rather zoom around the house or tackle one of her brothers (she loves them, but is definitely the alpha). Ugandi prefers to be on the move rather than sit and cuddle, but once you win her trust, she\u0027ll greet you with a purr and a quick nose kiss - before running off to a new adventure. She can be skittish when you first meet her, so you will need to allow her time to learn to trust you; even then, her personality is such that she is a mover-and-a-shaker, not a snuggly cat. She has interacted with the rowdy four-year-old child in her foster home, but she would do best in a home with adults and calmer, older children. It\u0027s never a dull moment with Ugandi! Contact us today to arrange a meet \u0026 greet. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Usher is an adorable little butterball of a kitten who is totally content to snuggle in your lap! And if you have drawstrings on your pants, even better - he\u0027ll be entertained for hours! Otherwise, Usher\u0027s favorite toy is a stuffed goldfish on a string. (So you see he prefers string toys.) He\u0027ll grab it in his mouth and awkwardly drag it around, as proud as if he actually caught it! You can\u0027t help but beam with pride for him. Usher has a bit of a mama\u0027s boy personality, but don\u0027t let it fool you - he can hold his own! His feisty side comes out when he is playing with his brother (Underwood) or sister (Ugandi). Usher has interacted with the rowdy four-year-old child in his foster home, but he would probably do best in a home with adults and calmer, older children. Contact us today to meet this sweetheart!

But don\u0027t think it\u0027s go-go-go all the time, because he definitely likes to take a rest to cuddle with you. Are you a human? Great, because Paperclip loves all humans - adults and little humans! He is a favorite with kids because of his fun nature and \"cuddleability\". Paperclip has been exposed to Feline Leukemia (FeLV). We are waiting until one month from the time he was last exposed to a kitty with a virus to retest him and confirm that he is negative. If he does retest positive, it is possible for kittens six months and younger to shed this virus completely and test negative, and he will be re-tested for FeLV at his six month birthday, at which time a definitive diagnosis can be assured. For now, he should live with no other cats or kittens - except possibly his sister, Pencil! Paperclip is available for adoption now to adopters who can accommodate a feline leukemia positive, or negative, cat.

    "description": "Affectionate, Loving, Playful Princess Bride is the ultimate lap cat, and you\u0027ll find it easy to give her all the cuddles she asks for. One look into her big green eyes reveals her warm nature and big heart. She\u0027s not too clingy, though, and is often content entertaining herself as if she were a kitten again. You see, PB has been through a lot after losing a litter of kittens, but she\u0027s ready to rebuild and let as much love into her life as you can give. Her soft striped coat and playfulness make her pretty irresistible, too. PB would do best in a home without other pets for the most part. She could probably warm up to another cat given some time and patience, but dogs aren\u0027t really her style. However, her foster is confident that she\u0027d be great with kids! If you\u0027re looking for a playful yet non-destructive, affectionate, and loving cat, she\u0027d be a wonderful addition to your home.

    "description": "Adorable, Adventurous, Cuddly Roses Are Red Violets are Blue Dr. Zhivago is the perfect kitten for you! Burrows and naps on your chest, So sweet to you because he\u0027s the best! Not just loving but playful and fun If you leave the room here he comes! He\u0027s the perfect tiny friend Who will be with you to the end. Adopt me! He pleads, And I will purr and knead And love on you!! This handsome black and white little boy will do anything but bore you! And he won\u0027t sit still long enough to sit through the movie he\u0027s named after - unless you give him lots of rubs. Dr. Zhivago is a rambunctious man who loves to be petted, but is too busy to be held for long. He will play with anything he can get his cute white paws on - especially laser pointers! (Which he can\u0027t technically put his paws on, but he still tries.) Dr. Zhivago loves attention and he will let you know when he isn\u0027t getting enough! Meows for pets! He has been known to enthusiastically - and literally - bounce off a wall. He really likes playing with your hair and will sit on your feet while you\u0027re getting ready for work. He\u0027s your personal valet! We can\u0027t make a fancy rhyme out of these, but here are some other personality traits of Dr. Zhivago: well-behaved, warm, friendly, fun, playful, active, and lovable! Dr. Zhivago does well with other critters and kids. He needs a home where he can get lots of attention - he needs someone to spoil him! Dr. Zhivago is one of hundreds of cats and kittens that APA! has rescued from the perils of Hurricane Harvey. Most of these kitties are up for adoption and in need of a forever home.The greatest result of a rescue is the creation of loving relationships. Share in this joy with us and adopt a cat or kitten and create your own rescue love story! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Dr. Zhivago, please [email protected]",

She was rescued as a hungry baby with no family; she overcame that, only to come down with panleukopenia, which is a serious illness for kittens - but she overcame that, too! You might think that the look on Yolanda\u0027s face is one of a kitty who is hard to impress! On her own at a young age - didn\u0027t impress her; serious illness - didn\u0027t impress her; the minor skin fungus (aka ringworm) she is being treated for - doesn\u0027t impress her (and is certainly no big deal to this hearty survivor; she\u0027ll be over it in no time with no lasting effects). You know what WOULD impress Yolanda? Having a family to love her, shower her with affection, play with her, and keep her safe. Now you\u0027re talkin\u0027! Contact us today to impress Yolanda; if ever a kitten has \"earned\" a loving home, it is her! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip.

    "description": "Drogon may be small, but don\u0027t let his size fool you, this one has a larger than life personality! He is a sweet natured little guy with a heart as big as his character and lots of love and affection to give. He is a quintessential tabby with all the markings to go along with it, including that signature \u0027M\u0027 on the forehead. He has unique coloring to go along with his spots and stripes, with bits of gray, brown, and orange he\u0027s sure to impress. He\u0027s also got two white lines down his back that look like racing stripes, with the cutest little white paws with black paw pads. Drogon is definitely one of a kind. Drogon loves to wrestle and play with his kitten and dog siblings and is very curious about everything he comes across. He loves exploring and discovering new things in his world. He\u0027s sure to become your new best friend and will stick by your side for adventures and kisses. He has been around both dogs and cats and would fit best in a home that will give lots of attention, cuddles, and lets his curiosity take him to new and exciting places... like the top of a cat house or a shoulder! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Drogon, please email [email protected]",

    "description": "Petite, Sweet, Gentle You might wonder what\u0027s up with Beanie Weenie\u0027s ear; she has an ear hematoma, which means that some blood has leaked and collected outside the blood vessels, causing a visible mass. She also has a small one on her face, but once she has corrective surgery, the first thing you notice will probably be her beautiful gray and brown stripes, as well as the cute white socks on her back feet. Plus, she is a small cat - super adorable in a tiny package! Beanie Weenie can be nervous when you first meet her (and may even give a hiss or two) - we suspect that it is mostly due to the fact that the hematomas are uncomfortable for her - but go slowly with her and she will show you how sweet she is. (Hint: Crinkle a bag of treats and she will come running.) She isn\u0027t into cuddling yet, but likes attention, will follow you around the house, and will sit next to you on the sofa. She will also weave around your legs and rub her head on you. And she doesn\u0027t mind if you pick her up - the best way to do that is to tuck her securely under your arm (like a football!); when she is done being held, she will signal to you with a quiet meow. Beanie Weenie likes to check everything out in the house - so far, in her foster home she has explored the wine rack, the top of the fridge, and a cubbyhole in the TV cabinet. After these bursts of energy she will settle down for a long nap; and if she\u0027s not IN the TV cabinet, she seems to like to sit on the sofa and watch golf! Beanie Weenie is a quiet and chill girl looking for similar quiet and chill people to live with! She likes her kitty-cat boundaries respected. If this sweetness sounds perfect for you, contact us today to arrange a meet \u0026 greet. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Beanie Weenie, please email [email protected]",

    "description": "Charming, Chatty, Charismatic At only two years old, this terrific tabby knows how to live life to its fullest. She loves leap and pounce, playing with toy mice or even balled up pieces of paper. Anything and everything is a toy in Ceylon\u0027s world. She is a confident kitty that quickly acclimates to different environments, and is quite chatty about sharing her feelings or just making idle conversation. Want to road trip? Ceylon is ready to ride, and no doubt will want to try a turn at reading the map! (So those trips to the vet should be stress-free!). And, while life appears to all fun and games, Ceylon has a tender side as well, wanting to cuddle and bump against your leg to remind you to slow down, enjoy life, and perhaps catch a nap together. She has lived with another cat and dog, and is respectful of their space. Not knowing how she is around children, she might need to be monitored during a transitional period as she does tend to play with feet, circle around legs, and play a fun game of attack. If you are looking for an outgoing cat that has a zest for life and a love for shared adventures, Ceylon is your purrrfect match! Ceylon is one of hundreds of cats and kittens that APA! has rescued from the perils of Hurricane Harvey. Most of these kitties are up for adoption and in need of a forever home. The greatest result of a rescue is the creation of loving relationships. Share in this joy with us and adopt a cat or kitten and create your own rescue love story! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Laid-back, Affectionate, Independent Bun is a lady that plays hard to get. She may act like she doesn\u0027t want your attention, but when she thinks you aren\u0027t paying attention she\u0027ll snuggle right up to you on the couch, at the foot of your bed, or even in your lap in a chair. Like most cats, Bun is an avid napper. She also loves exploring around the house for perches to nap on - desks, chairs, couches, etc. Her favorite place to relax is a windowsill - she can sit and watch the cars and squirrels all day. Bun hasn\u0027t really gotten a chance to know her fellow foster home cats quite yet, so she isn\u0027t sure how she feels about them. She would probably do fine with a quiet house mate who kept to itself or as an only pet. Bun\u0027s ideal home would have lots of windows for her to gaze pensively out of, and a human companion that needs a cat to warm their lap while working at a desk. Bun is one of hundreds of cats and kittens that APA! has rescued from the perils of Hurricane Harvey. Most of these kitties are up for adoption and in need of a forever home. The greatest result of a rescue is the creation of loving relationships. Share in this joy with us and adopt a cat or kitten and create your own rescue love story! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Energetic - Curious - Fearless Sourdough is sweeter than her name suggests, but her energy and zest for life are what she\u0027s known for. When Sourdough arrived in her foster home, she was so excited to have a new place to explore that she zoomed circles around the house. Running and chasing any and everything-toys, shadows, cats, people-are her two main hobbies. She loves to stalk and pounce-she might use a human shield while she takes in her prey with her huge eyes before she strikes. You might want to shut the door when you\u0027re scooping her litter box, because Sourdough has been known to interpret this action as some kind of a game! She\u0027s not picky about toys and can make her own fun, but Sourdough prefers to be occupied. While she enjoys attention and being held, she doesn\u0027t sit still for long. She\u0027s certainly not a wallflower and doesn\u0027t seem fazed by much-she loves to chase and play with her (unrelated) feline foster sister and has shown interest in dogs. Since Sourdough is a kitten, she is still learning to play gently and probably wouldn\u0027t be a good match for a household with young kids at this stage. Having plenty of scratching posts around the house is key so Sourdough learns appropriate scratching behavior. Sourdough isn\u0027t shy and will pipe up with a meow or two to let you know if she needs attention. She will curl up from time to time and purr against your chest, but you have to be prepared to snap back into play mode at the drop of the hat. Life with Sourdough would not be boring! Sourdough would do best in a loving home where she has playmates who can help her burn off her energy, as well as patient humans (and maybe some felines) who can reinforce the importance of gentle play and good scratching behavior. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

This active guy loves to run around like a madman, chasing his fellow kitten pals with excitement. When Teacake is awake, you can expect to find him in perpetual motion and doing his own thing. Teacake likes to think of himself as a cat toy enthusiast; small balls, stuffed toys he can carry around in his mouth, even paper - you name it! He\u0027ll play with just about anything that isn\u0027t nailed to the floor! Teacake is not very chatty, so while he might not vocalize his emotions, you can certainly see how he\u0027s feeling when he\u0027s in playtime mode. As one might expect, Teacake\u0027s active lifestyle makes it hard for him to sit still and enjoy too much snuggling or being held. Although he does tolerate affection, Teacake is somewhat skittish, so he would prefer minimal handling or being cuddled so he can focus on exerting his endless energy! Teacake is a beautiful guy who embodies the looks of a little panther. He\u0027s great with other kittens, but has not yet met any dogs or kids, and kids might be a little too much for him to handle. Tea Cake would be happiest in a forever home that\u0027s on the quieter side and where he can have a playmate to challenge to his numerous crazy races and games!

He can\u0027t get enough love. And he purrs immediately on the first pet. While Pita won\u0027t turn down a cuddle session, he is obsessed with playtime!! It is kind of difficult for this little kitty to sit still! All he needs is some good toys, a cat tower to climb around on and some interactive play with his humans and he\u0027ll be happy. He loves ball toys, stuffed animals, and toys on a string. He also loves playing with your shoes and the strings on your shorts - typical kitten stuff! Pita likes to run around and chase things. He is a really handsome little guy who looks like a little baby bobcat with those tiny tufts of dark fur at the tips of his ears. And the fur on his nose is a cute rusty color. He is also very soft and his black stripes are pretty. Pita does well with the two kittens he came to foster with however, he likes to wrestle with his litter mate and he has gotten a little too rough once or twice. He is still learning how to play without using his claws, and he\u0027s a little mischievous--though, not aggressive. Pita\u0027s ideal home would be full of toys and people who shower him with the love and attention that he deserves! Pita could live with other animals, but he could also be happy as an only pet! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

She wants to be her person\u0027s #1 and chirps with joy when you pet her. She likes being held and if you are sitting down and doing something other than paying attention to her, she will jump up on your back and lay across your shoulders.

Balls, stuffed animals, string toys, the string on your shorts--you name it and Luna is into it. She can run and jump with the best of them and likes to wrestle with her litter mate. Luna\u0027s ideal home would have people who would be able to play with her and give her cuddles! If there are other cats in the home, they would need to be more independent and passive than Luna.

    "description": "Cuddly, People-seeking, Affectionate Bing is king when it comes to pouncing on moving things! Little balls, wand toys, and other cats beware - it\u0027s hard for this curious kitten to resist attacking anything that can be batted around the room or chased! Bing isn\u0027t a huge fan of being carried, but he enjoys other kinds of affection. He loves people and will often seek out a nice lap to curl up on in hopes of being stroked and petted - a guaranteed way to get him purring loudly! He isn\u0027t a very vocal kitty, but Bing knows how to get your attention by rubbing his body against your ankles and walking his feet up your leg. He knows you can\u0027t resist his charm! Bing is a handsome kitten who is the perfect blend of brown tabby from his ears to his tail and some white covering his front arms, chest, and part of his face. He hasn\u0027t been introduced to dogs or kids yet, but might do well with older kids, as long as they respect his desire to not be held or carried. The perfect forever home for Bing is one that\u0027s on the quieter side and where he\u0027ll receive lots of physical affection from his humans. He\u0027s a big cuddler, so a nice lap and a good pair of petting hands are important for this sweet guy! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Bing, please email [email protected]",

    "description": "Underhill isn\u0027t a complicated guy - he likes to play and he likes to cuddle. A Hurricane Harvey rescue, he and his mom have settled into their foster home and they\u0027re doing beautifully. Underhill has a lot of kitten energy to burn off-he\u0027ll go from running around and playing to napping and then repeat the cycle again. He loves playing with and chasing a ribbon more than any fancy cat toys. He also likes to play with hands and feet, so don\u0027t be surprised if he greets you at the door with a pounce. He does give a little kiss after he love bites, but he\u0027s still learning to play gently. Underhill likes to snuggle up next to you for a nap and his preference is to nest in your hair on your pillow. This little cuddle bunny has been through a lot in his short life and is ready to find his forever home. Underhill would thrive in almost any loving home-he just needs some humans (and maybe some other pets) who can keep up with him! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Curious, Friendly, Chatty Pippi Longstocking is just about as adorable as they come. A curious little creature, you won\u0027t see her lazing about very much because she\u0027s too busy exploring and watching the world go by outside the window. She loves to be the first one through any door you open to see what\u0027s inside. But when it\u0027s time to cuddle, you\u0027ll know it! Pippi will put her fluffy little paw on you and meow to let you know it\u0027s time for some pets. She prefers a nice seat next to you most of the time, but sometimes she\u0027ll grace your lap. She loves to follow you around and chit chat, too. Her meowing isn\u0027t too loud, though, and she also makes the quirkiest little grumbles to talk back at you. Pippi\u0027s foster says that she\u0027s the sweetest cat they\u0027ve ever taken care of! Her mega fluffy tuxedo coat doesn\u0027t hurt, either. And to top it all off, she\u0027s got a heart-shaped splotch right in the middle of her nose -- fitting for such a loving creature. While we haven\u0027t seen her interact directly with other cats, kids, or dogs, Pippi\u0027s foster says that with her friendly personality, she\u0027d probably do fine around mellow cats and gentle children, but maybe not so much dogs. She\u0027d do best in a home where there\u0027s someone in the house a lot of the time to give her the love and attention she yearns for (and deserves)! Pippi is one of hundreds of cats and kittens that APA! has rescued from the perils of Hurricane Harvey. Most of these kitties are up for adoption and in need of a forever home. The greatest result of a rescue is the creation of loving relationships. Share in this joy with us and adopt a cat or kitten and create your own rescue love story!

    "description": "Selectively Cuddly, Quite Curious, Smart With Syrup in charge, things run like clockwork! He is regal and firmly believes he is King of the Household. He chooses his inner court, with the chosen ones receiving his warmest affection. Actually, it\u0027s not very complicated how he chooses his favorites; if you are the first to arrive home, you are his favorite! He will follow you around and supervise your activities, making sure that anything that has to do with him is performed to high standards. That means a warm lap to cuddle in, a chest to purr on, and at bedtime, a human to sleep with. And if you haven\u0027t quite made his inner circle (yet), he will accept petting and scratching from you as you watch TV, rewarding you with his purr. So you see, Syrup is a kind ruler! And one who smartly recognizes his limitations. The dog in his foster home is blind, and is very curious about Syrup. Syrup is fine being in the same room with her, though he still keeps a safe distance; but he has figured out how to quietly and stealthily move around her to stay below her radar! He respects her, so uses his clever catness to get along. Though a bit advanced in age, Syrup still has a favorite toy: any toy on a string! He is so over toys with bells or toys that make a noise. He moves smoothly and elegantly when he jumps on the bed or runs around, his eyes alert and earnest and his ears pointy and perky. It interests him to roam the house, checking out nooks and crannies, and looking for new places to hang out - especially if they are elevated, like in a window, where he can survey his kingdom. Perhaps he would like a strategically-placed cat tree in his new home? Syrup is working to gain some weight, and has some dental issues to be resolved. He is a healthy FIV+ (Feline Immunodeficiency Virus) cat. FIV+ cats typically live long, healthy lives! For more information, please contact APA! or read this FAQ: http://bestfriends.org/Resources/FAQs-About-Feline-Immunodeficiency-Virus-FIV Syrup\u0027s ideal home would have places to explore, climb, and lounge, with people who will spoil him exceedingly. He has been around teenagers, and as long as he has peaceful places to nap and a warm lap to cuddle in, he is good-to-go! Contact us today to meet this chic and exquisite gentleman. Syrup is one of hundreds of cats and kittens that APA! has rescued from the perils of Hurricane Harvey. Most of these kitties are up for adoption and in need of a forever home. The greatest result of a rescue is the creation of loving relationships. Share in this joy with us and adopt a cat or kitten and create your own rescue love story! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Precious, Soft, Curious October is a beautiful, sweet, soft, and affectionate girl who loves to run and play! She has gorgeous fluffy fur with unique tortoiseshell markings that make her one of a kind. She is a runner! Her favorite game is to dart around and play her own version of hide and seek and then fall fast asleep, preferably cuddling with her human companions. She also loves looking out the window at the world and taking naps in the sun. She is the perfect mix of play and snuggle. October may be a little shy at first, but warms up quickly... especially when it\u0027s time to eat! Once she\u0027s warmed up to you she loves to chat and remind you if it\u0027s time for food, or to greet you at the door when you come home. She has been around both dogs and cats, but seems to prefer cats and she would fit right into any home that has lots of love to give. If you\u0027re looking for a playful and affectionate cat, contact us to meet your new snuggle buddy, October.

She loves to be around people and animals that appreciate her athletic skills and will let her \"show off\" through play. She is 100% a \"big sister\" to her brother and even sits on him playfully. Her obvious leadership personality is fun to watch! Tuesday takes her play time seriously and enjoys respectful petting and playful kids. She is slow to choose a lap but loves to have pets, strokes and tickles. She doesn\u0027t like to be picked up and walked around. She prefers to keep her paws on the ground. She warmed up to her foster parent and enjoys attention. She\u0027ll prefer a setting with other animals. Tuesday is patient, allowing the dog in her foster family to show its personality before she responds. She allows herself to be sniffed and followed. If the dog bores her she walks away. If the dog annoys her she lays down until it walks away. She\u0027s pretty confident. Her facial fur makes an eye mask that gives her a superhero appearance. Her fur is thick and her tail is expressive.Tuesday has a husky, croaky meow that she uses for greetings and to alert you to her needs.

She has a beautiful coat with unique markings and a big, fluffy tail that make her one of a kind. She likes a good conversation when you come home, as if she\u0027s asking about your day, and she has the cutest little mew to match her graceful personality. While she\u0027s not one to jump onto your lap, she loves when you pick her up for snuggles and chin scratches. She is very curious when it comes to toys and is still learning how to play. Laura mostly bats at toy mice inquisitively and then chases after them when she feels the zoomies coming on. Her favorite thing to do, is scratch her cat post. She would love a playmate that is close to her age or is just as playful. This sweet girl is dainty and pretty particular about her litter box; after trying a few types of litter, she has agreed to use the recycled paper-type litter; clumping litter doesn\u0027t work for her. She would fit best in a home that lets her get used to her surroundings and loves her little quirks. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip.

    "description": "Friendly, Affectionate, Laid-Back Kissimmee, aka \"Silverfox\", because of his handsome sweetness and soft silver tabby coat, is a mellow and easygoing snuggler who purrs like an engine! With loving green eyes and a cute floppy ear, he will lure you into his lair of affection by cozying into your lap, arms, ...or pillow even! Although he is the purrfect nuzzler, he also enjoys infrequent bursts of energy, playing hide and seek and lazily swatting at string toys. Yet is most content simply chilling with his human companion. A bit of a watch-cat, he will quietly patrol the house in search of any odd noises. The only time you will hear him speak is when he is ready to eat or wants you to give him kitty massages! He will be especially happy if you scritchy-scratch his all-time favorite spots; head, chest, chin and tail base! Kissimmee is ideal for a relaxed homebody person who would enjoy having a companion while reading, napping or watching movies and would likely do best in a house that has a lot of pillows! He would make a great companion to a senior or even in a home with an attentive kid who might enjoy replacing that stuffed animal with a real one! Kissimmee is one of hundreds of cats and kittens that APA! has rescued from the perils of Hurricane Harvey. Most of these kitties are up for adoption and in need of a forever home. The greatest result of a rescue is the creation of loving relationships. Share in this joy with us and adopt a cat or kitten and create your own rescue love story! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Kissimmee, please email [email protected]",

    "description": "Kingsley loves other cats! She will run right up to a new kitty, introduce herself, and try to make friends. She came to APA! with another cat who turned out to be a pregnant mom, so they had to go their separate ways; they were closely bonded, and Kingsley is lonely by herself. She has even tried to make friends with the elderly cat in her foster home, who flatly turned her down; Kingsley respects that, and maintains her cheerful and sunny outlook on life. She is desperate for a new cat buddy, and she is optimistic that she will find one! Kingsley loves people, too, and will follow you around the house like the most obedient and faithful dog! She has an amazingly super-loud, chirpy purr that you have to hear to believe. And you will definitely hear it, not only because it\u0027s loud, but because she purrs quite often! Due to a paperwork mixup, everyone thought Kingsley was a boy when she came to APA! Hence her rather masculine name. But we think it is rather regal, and uber-sweet and approachable Kingsley easily carries it off. Kingsley plays in her water dish, daintily dipping her paw into the water when she drinks - it is a cute and endearing habit (though you might want to get a sturdy bowl that she can\u0027t tip over accidentally)! Kingsley is a gem! Contact us today to arrange a meet \u0026 greet. Kingsley is one of hundreds of cats and kittens that APA! has rescued from the perils of Hurricane Harvey.

Whitney is an extremely loving cat who loves cuddling almost as much as she likes playing with her squeaky mouse toy or a bit of string. Her foster parent describes her as \"very playful, but well-behaved.\" Whitney is friendly with new people and old friends alike. Her ideal home would be one with equal parts play and cuddles! Whitney is really loving bonding with her feline foster sibling. They play and eat together every day. She would love to go to a home with another cat for company! We don\u0027t have any information on Whitney would be with dogs, but she\u0027s so outgoing and friendly to people and animals that it\u0027s a distinct possibility she could learn to love a canine pal. Whitney would be great with children that are old enough to play gently with her. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip.

    "description": "Quiet, affectionate, cuddly Well, Mango certainly has a story to tell. More than one probably, having been one of the evacuees from Hurricane Harvey and all. That\u0027s right, this fluffy, gray female tabby with the cute little white chin is just one more example, if a somewhat more extreme one, of APA! volunteers\u0027 dedication to rescuing as many furry creatures as humanly-and humanely-possible. Even after everything Mango has experienced, including an upper respiratory infection that\u0027s made napping one of her favorite pastimes, her calm, patient demeanor is inspiring to behold. She\u0027ll cuddle with you anywhere. But, her favorite nap spot include the bed, an Amazon box tucked under the bed and the desk chair, even when you\u0027re in it. Once she warms up to you, let the head rubs and chin rubs commence! Should you discontinue the rubs, she will catch the offending hand and purr mightily until the festivities are resumed. She greets her foster as soon as she gets home from school, sits upon her feet if they stand still too long, eats with her in the kitchen and loves snuggling in bed, touching noses and bestowing tiny love nibbles. Of course, some things are just too much, even for Mango. When it\u0027s time for her daily antibiotics, she just shuts her mouth and turns away. You know, like a little kid. No hissy fit. No histrionics. But, her antibiotics are doing the trick. As Mango has started feeling better, her playful side is coming through. She now loves chasing fake mice and doing battle with other ferocious toys. After her hurricane adventure, Mango would certainly appreciate a nice, quiet, loving home with plenty of prime napping spots. Not much to ask under the circumstances. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

Seriously, Gaston\u0027s fur feels like what you\u0027d imagine an angel\u0027s hair to feel like. Gaston came from a flooded Houston shelter so he is still kind of timid and scared, but warms up slowly but surely. He prefers to sleep in tight spaces like boxes or even suitcases! He likes to have a safe space. Sometimes he is hesitant to be held or pet, but once you start scratching his chin he melts! He adores chin rubs. Gaston\u0027s favorite toys are jingly strings and ball tracks. He can bat the ball around the track like a pro! Gaston also really enjoys the company of his \"sister\" (foster mate) Conroe. Conroe makes him feel safe and they enjoy playing together! Gaston\u0027s ideal home would be relatively chill since he is timid, but he would love someone to give him pets and chin rubs.

She has rich and glossy black fur with hazel eyes (or are they green? or yellow? you will have to meet her and decide for yourself), and she will captivate your mind, body, and soul. Pickwick is called \"Kaida\" by her foster mom, which means \"Little Dragon\". She is super playful and can take down her big brothers with no problem at all! She may be small but it doesn\u0027t hold her back one bit. Pickwick gets excited when she sees you, MEEE-OWing a warm greeting! And instantly show her affection. She will climb into your lap and touch your face with her paws. Sometimes she will even love-nibble your fingers. Giving and receiving love is her super power! Pickwick is very active! She plays with toys and her brothers, Pinnocle and Oliver. They do a great job of keeping themselves entertained. (Her dream human would be someone willing to adopt them all together!) Pickwick is being treated for a SUPER MINOR case of ringworm exposure. But it\u0027s temporary, has no lasting effects, and is no big thang! If you have room in your heart to adopt Pickwick, she will love you forever! She is an absolute gem.

Though he is the largest of his siblings, he is the most docile (though they are all gentle and easy-going). Oliver is a pretty relaxed kitten! Oliver does love to play, especially with little mice toys attached to strings. Chasing them back and forth brings him (and you, just watching him) such joy! Oliver is super affectionate and a cuddler! He loves to have his belly rubbed when he stretches out on his back. He is a professional Air Kneader, too; when you love on him his paws spontaneously begin to make biscuits! Oliver is a well-behaved, good little boy; he is being treated for a MINOR case of ringworm and takes his treatments with dignity and style. (Ringworm is temporary, has no lasting effects, and is no big thang!) Sometimes Pickwick will look into your eyes and seem to smile; add his green-golden eyes and glossy black coat, and he is one handsome, sweet little dude. It would be great if Oliver could find a home with his brother, PInnocle, and sister, Pickwick! They had a rough time, having to deal with Hurricane Harvey. They can say unequivocally that feeling loved and safe is truly the best feeling ever! Oliver is one of hundreds of cats and kittens that APA! has rescued from the perils of Hurricane Harvey.

Being petted feels sooooo good, especially a nice chin scratch! And don\u0027t let his shy demeanor fool you, he absolutely LOVES to play! He is actually a bit of a roughhouser and bounces around in a typical, kitten-like manner. He plays with toys and can entertain himself, but most of all he loves to play with his brother, Oliver, and sister, Pickwick. You might be surprised to learn that of the three, he can out-play all of them! Pinnocle is slim and athletic, with golden-green eyes and a rich black coat. He is currently being treated for a MINOR case of ringworm. It\u0027s temporary, has no lasting effects, and is no big thang! Pinnocle would love to go home with one - or better yet, both - of his siblings. Being with them makes him feel happy and safe. With them by his side, he can more easily open his heart and trust. He wants someone to love him for the rest of his life; he\u0027s in for a lifetime commitment. Pinnocle is a wonderful little cat! Pinnocle is one of hundreds of cats and kittens that APA! has rescued from the perils of Hurricane Harvey. Most of these kitties are up for adoption and in need of a forever home. The greatest result of a rescue is the creation of loving relationships. Share in this joy with us and adopt a cat or kitten and create your own rescue love story! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

When Conroe wants some affection (almost always) she\u0027ll look up at you with her big eyes and politely put her paw on you. She even lets you hold her like a baby! Conroe is also very spunky and playful. She will play with just about anything but her favorite toys are string toys and anything that dangles really. Conroe also really enjoys the company of her foster brother, Gaston. You can often find them getting into mischief together or just curled up together for a snooze, it\u0027s very sweet! Conroe\u0027s ideal home would be either with her brother to keep her busy or with a family willing to play with her and give her the attention she craves. She\u0027s sweet as can be so don\u0027t hesitate to meet her!

    "description": "Gentle - Friendly - Playful Juniper is a beautiful tortoiseshell cat with an orange stripe right down her nose. She is a very polite and proper guest in her foster home - her foster mom can\u0027t believe how excellent Juniper\u0027s claw etiquette is. She has never scratched anything in appropriately and is exceptionally gentle when playing. She\u0027s also not very loud-while she does purr, she\u0027s more likely to sweetly chirp than meow if she would like to play. Her favorite toys are those that are interactive with a human; Juniper loves wand toys with feathers. Another favorite way to spend time is watching birds through the window. Juniper enjoys playing with her feline foster sister, Sourdough, and has shown interest in the resident dogs, although they have not yet interacted. She has never shown fear or defensiveness when she\u0027s spotted them. Due to her calm and gentle nature, it is likely that she would do fine with a cat-savvy dog and certainly with feline-loving children. Although Juniper is not a lap cat, she enjoys being near humans and being petted-head scratches are her favorite. With her laid back disposition, Juniper would likely thrive in any loving home where she has a good window to watch the world go by. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Did you know that only about 20% of Orange tabby cats are female? Victoria is a rare find which makes her extra special!! This sweet little girl was rescued along with her mom and 4 brothers and sisters after Hurricane Harvey. Lucky for them, they quickly found themselves in the hands of very loving foster who swooped them up and is giving them lots of love to help them get big and strong and ready for their FURever homes!! Victoria is the tiniest of the litter but doesn\u0027t let that stop her. She loves to climb and play, especially with her brother Victor, who happens to be the largest of the bunch. She isn\u0027t at all skittish and isn\u0027t afraid of anything. Heck, she\u0027s already been through a LOT in her short little life having braved a big storm and the move to Austin! Once she wears herself down playing she likes being held and snuggled. She hasn\u0027t met a person she didn\u0027t like and when she met the resident dog, she just gave him a look and went on about her playing. She would be a great addition to any household! Victoria is one of hundreds of cats and kittens that APA! has rescued from the perils of Hurricane Harvey. Most of these kitties are up for adoption and in need of a forever home.

Once she\u0027s targeted her toy prey of choice, Doris lights up with excitement, her big eyes appearing even bigger and brightening up against her pretty black fur. Doris is a lover at heart - she\u0027s never far from her siblings and loves to be around them for plenty of snuggle time. She has not yet met any dogs or kids, though. Doris can be shy, and if picked up right after an exciting play session, she might channel all of her energy and excitement into a little hiss, but she is working hard on her social skills and quickly learning! Shyness aside, Doris is a very polite kitten and has never once tried to bite or swat at her humans. She just needs a little patience and lots of love and attention to become to her best self!

    "description": "Outgoing, energetic, mischievous Ontario is a full-grown cat but still has the super-charged energy of a kitten. She loves any and all toys, but is still learning that human appendages aren\u0027t toys. She does play rough, so in addition to the usual balls and wand toys, she also needs some bigger toys (like stuffed animals) that she can bite and bunny-kick. Ontariomom is a little hissy at first with new cats, but she eventually warms up to them and wants to play. She needs an active buddy who will welcome her rambunctiousness. We haven\u0027t seen her with dogs or kids, but given her penchant for rough play, she\u0027d do best in an adult-only home. Ontariomom does enjoy attention and cuddles. It\u0027s best to cuddle her after she\u0027s tired out from an energetic play session - then she\u0027ll be less likely to start play-biting and rough-housing with your hands. She also needs someone who can play with her a lot to help her burn off her energy, and who will teach her the difference between toys and human body parts. Ontariomom is one of hundreds of cats and kittens that APA! has rescued from the peril of Hurricane Harvey. Most of these kitties are up for adoption and in need of a forever home. That\u0027s why for the month of September, adoption fees will be waived on all APA! cats and kittens. This includes kitties of every age, in foster and at every adoption location. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Ontariomom, please email us at [email protected]",

    "description": "Active, Friendly, Fun Appalachia can\u0027t wait to meet ya! This friendly feline is a sweet guy who loves to play with his kitten pals. He\u0027s curious, outgoing, and always on the go; at any moment you can catch Appalachia running around, pouncing on some unsuspecting toy, chasing his buddies, or investigating some new object - he loves to keep busy! Appalachia loves playtime more than anything! Some of his favorite things to do are play with his ball in track toy, bat small balls around, and attack bathrobe belts. Another guilty pleasure of his is finding things to drag around the room - he loves emptying the laundry basket of little things he finds to carry about. When he\u0027s not feeling super playful, Appalachia will sit still for a little cuddling but just for a few moments. He\u0027s also a big fan of mealtime, meowing excitedly when food is brought to him. When it comes to his looks, Appalachia is sleek and lithe like a gorgeous little black panther. He hasn\u0027t been introduced to dogs or kids yet, but he would probably prefer a home without small kids so he can avoid too much handling. Due to his friendly nature, Appalachia would do well in almost any home, but he would love one where he can find lots of interesting things to play with and will receive a little cuddling here and there. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

She enjoys being petted and talked to and will give you that sideways look as if she really is taking in what you are saying. She may choose to sleep under a bed or furniture but when you walk in the room she pops out and greets you with the sweetest little meow! She\u0027s a little sassy girl and loves to play with toys. She\u0027s a great jumper and loves to do tricks for the right toys - wand toys, string balls, you name it! She will play with anything that looks like it would be fun. She has a supermodel look with long legs and a sleek slender body. Her coloring is unusual and has a very sweet face. She has stripes inside her patches with White as her predominant color. Ashwood needs a quieter home with adults or older kids. Someone who can play with her and enjoy her company. She\u0027s a little fearful of loud noises and will need a slow integration process in her FURever home. Ashwood is one of hundreds of cats and kittens that APA! has rescued from the perils of Hurricane Harvey. Most of these kitties are up for adoption and in need of a forever home.

    "description": "Adorable, tiny, and chill Winona is a very special little lady!! She has a unique personality that you can\u0027t help but love. She is a TINY, fluffy, medium-haired little tabby with big, round eyes that watch the world around her intently. Everything about this little floof ball is adorable!! Winona is a sweet, laid back, independent girl. She zigs when the world zags. When her energetic foster siblings are distracted by playing with toys, she takes the opportunity to get some scratches in on her scratching post, has a meal and uses the litter box in peace. Basically everything Winona does is the cutest. She does not enjoy being held but she will come lay on your lap on her terms. She is pretty passive and she is in foster with two other very outgoing kitties. If she had more one on one time with her person, she would probably initiate even more lap time. She does however like to walk up and sit right next to you for pets and has a little, silent meow that she will give you. When she meows, which is not very often, essentially nothing comes out!! She does have a loud, rumbly purr and as you pet her, she will purr and purr! It is precious! Winona likes to play with stuffed animals and toys on strings. She likes to play independently by tossing a stuffed animal up in the air and pouncing on it. After play time and some dinner, she LOVES her naps! She really enjoys laying in her bed and kneading it until it is just right. She is great with the two other kittens she came into her current home with and while she has not been observed with other cats, she has a laid back personality that makes it seem she would be okay with them. She has not been around any dogs that we know of but she is the kind of cat who seems like she could be content almost anywhere. In a busy house with other animals, she would probably retreat and hang out on her own. In a quieter house, she might be a little more playful and affectionate. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Winona, please email [email protected]",

    "description": "Gorgeous, Sweet, Cuddly Milton is such a sweet, handsome fella! He\u0027s had a hard time of it lately due to circumstances beyond his control. He once had a home, but was taken to a vet clinic where he had to live for almost a month because his human didn\u0027t want him anymore. He was also declawed on all four of his paws. All this turmoil in Milton\u0027s life has made him nervous and the shelter environment has really put this poor guy on edge. Milton is so ready to put the past behind him and find his dream home! It would include someone who will love and care for him forever and who is big on cuddles! Milton is a very snuggly guy once he is comfortable with you and when this gray beauty is happily laying beside you, you\u0027ll wonder how anyone could have let him go. Milton not big on other cats, so a home where he is your one and only feline cuddle buddy is best. Milton is FeLV+ (Feline Leukemia Virus), which causes a weakened immune system and requires special care. APA! provides some medical assistance after adoption. Cats with FeLV typically have a shortened lifespan. Milton is not contagious to people or dogs, but should live only with other FeLV+ cats. For more information, please contact APA! or read more by our Partner, Best Friends Animal Society: http://bestfriends.org/Resources/FAQs-About-Feline-Leukemia-Virus-FeLV Due to Milton being declawed prior to his stay at APA!, he must remain an indoor cat. That\u0027s okay with him, since inside is where the best snuggles are found! Milton would love a quiet home where he could cozy up to someone and know that this time he will be a cherished family member always. If you have just the place for Milton in your home and in your heart, come by and meet him today! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Milton, please email [email protected]",

    "description": "Playful, Loving, Inquisitive Elsie has a sweet name to go with her sweet personality. She adheres to a strict \"purr first, ask questions later\" policy - as soon as you touch her, this little purr machine fires up on all cylinders! She\u0027s also a cuddle bug and is always ready to snuggle on the couch or the bed. If your house has an evening story time, Elsie would like to participate too please, and will curl up at the foot of the bed to listen in. In the morning, sneaky Elsie will hide under the bed and stealthily boop your feet as you walk by. Elsie\u0027s most favorite toy is anything feathery that she can toss to herself - she\u0027s cleverly figured out how to play fetch alone! She\u0027s most active in the morning, scurrying around, bopping feet, and checking out the birds outside, but other than that, Elsie prefers to lounge around and receive all the pets you can administer. Her foster family thinks that Elsie would enjoy leash time in the yard, given the way she eyes the wildlife outside. Elsie hasn\u0027t met any dogs yet, but when she was picked up from the shelter, she was peaceable housed with other cats. She\u0027s great with kids - always ready to snuggle and see what they\u0027re up to. Elsie\u0027s perfect home would be one with people who love to love on her, especially those who would like to try the leashed adventure cat lifestyle. Elsie is one of hundreds of cats and kittens that APA! has rescued from the perils of Hurricane Harvey. Most of these kitties are up for adoption and in need of a forever home. The greatest result of a rescue is the creation of loving relationships. Share in this joy with us and adopt a cat or kitten and create your own rescue love story! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

He has a love of playing games and is great with his team of siblings, but when you pick him up... ...he transforms into a purring cuddle puddle! Which is a hundred times (at least) better than a traditional sporting huddle. Varsity Hero is a beautiful black kitten with white hairs on his legs - he is dashing and handsome!

    "description": "Dramatic, goofy, sweet Champ is a beautiful orange tabby with a silly personality. His hobbies include getting himself tangled in bits of string, frantically rolling around on the floor, and staring at people while they eat. Unlike cats with normal eating habits, Champ likes to eat with his paws and occasionally tries to eat plants. Despite his weirdness, he\u0027s as sweet as can be. It took Champ a few weeks to let his foster parent touch him and who can blame him. Champ was rescued from Houston during Hurricane Harvey and that experience put a lot of stress on Champ. Now that he has had some time to relax, he sits in his foster mom\u0027s lap every morning while she has her coffee. When he\u0027s not in her lap he loves to sit on the couch and cuddle! Sometimes he sits in her lap, puts his paws up on her shoulders and just stares at her from two inches away. What a silly boy!! Champ\u0027s favorite toy is hair ties - he manages to wrap it around one of his paws and then rolls around frantically trying to get it off. He also likes to play with those wand toys. Champ is pretty quiet but meows whenever he sees his human for the first time in a while, like when I come home from work and when she gets home, he will sprint from room to room and roll around saying hello. What could be better that an adorable kitty greeting every day!! Champ is one of hundreds of cats and kittens that APA! has rescued from the perils of Hurricane Harvey. Most of these kitties are up for adoption and in need of a forever home. The greatest result of a rescue is the creation of loving relationships. Share in this joy with us and adopt a cat or kitten and create your own rescue love story! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Champ, please email [email protected]",

She once had a home, but became a Harvey refugee and now finds herself in a shelter environment. That\u0027s all pretty scary, especially when you\u0027re still just a kitten! As a result, she\u0027s quiet, shy, and a little scared. But once she gets to know you a bit, you can pick her up and she will relax into your arms and purr. We think with some time to relax in a home, she\u0027ll turn into a very loving cat. Super Cat loves her siblings and plays well with them. We don\u0027t know if she\u0027s ever met any adult cats, dogs, or kids. You can check out more pics and videos of Super Chicken and her kitten buddies on this Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/NutterButtercat/ Super Chicken is one of hundreds of cats and kittens that APA! has rescued from the peril of Hurricane Harvey. Most of these kitties are up for adoption and in need of a forever home. That\u0027s why for the month of September, adoption fees will be waived on all APA! cats and kittens. This includes kitties of every age, in foster and at every adoption location. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip.

    "description": "High-energy, cuddly, playful Arlo loves to be in the middle of everything! He\u0027s curious about the world around him, and investigates every new thing. His foster mom jokes that he is a \"frat boy in kitten clothing\". After a hard day of play with his siblings, Arlo will fling himself into your lap for some snuggles. WARNING: He is also an unrepentant taco thief, so guard your tacos. Arlo would do best with another kitten playmate - he loves to snuggle with his brother Yarnball, or baby brother Shiner. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

He\u0027s handsome, he wears a tuxedo, is super talkative, and absolutely loves to bask in the spotlight of your attention! Fennec is a crazy-busy boy who would be a great playmate for other young cats and kids. He gets along very well with his enclosure mates. He\u0027s energetic but not the least bit aggressive, and he clearly loves people. He\u0027ll follow you around, carrying on a conversation. He especially enjoys \"helping people clean his enclosure\" by playing with the broom while they sweep. Right now, Fennec is usually too busy playing and chatting to cuddle a lot, but we think he\u0027ll become a lap cat as he outgrows his kitten teen years. He would fit well into almost any active family. Fennec is one of hundreds of cats and kittens that APA! has rescued from the peril of Hurricane Harvey. Most of these kitties are up for adoption and in need of a forever home. That\u0027s why for the month of October, adoption fees will be waived on all APA! cats and kittens.

    "description": "Affectionate, friendly, curious This retired momcat is looking for a place to call home after getting her kittens ready to face the world! Natascha has a low-key personality, though she is still young and playful side; she is partial to little stuffed mice and a wand toys. She is affectionate and very sweet - in fact, she is really the perfect cat! She will allow you to hold her and pet her but hasn\u0027t yet made it to lap cat status. Now that she doesn\u0027t have to look out for her kittens 24/7, our hunch is that the more she is around her humans, the more likely she will be to increase her cuddling-up. She asks for attention by rubbing up against you with a soft little meow. She is a very pretty little lady with beautiful markings and really soft paws. And that little black dot on her nose is precious!! Natascha plays sweetly and gently with the 6-year-old child in her foster home, and she is okay with the two adult cats (though they are not very accepting of her). She has not been introduced to the resident canine but all indications are she wouldn\u0027t be bothered by a nice doggie. Looks like easy-going Natascha could fit into most any loving household! Contact us today to arrange a meet \u0026 greet. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Frisky, curious, adorable This handsome orange and white fellow\u0027s name is Randi. (Not Randy, thank you very much.) So far, anything that moves, most especially his toy mouse, has his undivided attention. Wanna take a nap, Randi? No thanks, it\u0027s mouse time! How about a nice...? Perhaps you didn\u0027t hear me...mouse time! Randi also devotes considerable time (unless it\u0027s mouse time!) to his two siblings, with spirited play and roughhousing being the order of the day. One thing that can drag him away from play time is dinner time, which he welcomes with a hearty meow or two. In fact, that\u0027s about as vociferous as he gets. Not one to complain, our Randi. Randi\u0027s cuddling and snuggling behaviors are also reserved mostly for his siblings. He\u0027s just too frisky and frolicsome to settle down for very long, especially for those tall, two-legged critters he sees around the house. As he gets older, he may discover the pleasure of a nice, long snooze on somebody\u0027s nice, warm lap. But for now, the closest he comes is allowing his foster\u0027s six-year-old and 15-year-old kids to pick him up, play with him, maybe even rub his little belly. Because he\u0027s so playful and companionable, we think the ideal home for Randi would probably be one with another cat or two to play with him and help him disperse all that energy he builds up during...what was it again? Oh, right...mouse time! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Frisky, affectionate, mischievous This little orange and white fluffball could easily have been named Broderick. Or Chowder. Instead, he\u0027s got the best of both worlds: Browder. Cool name, huh? We think so. And he would too, if he had some familiarity with the English alphabet. Anyway, Browder has proven to be the very definition of affectionate: super cuddly with his mom and siblings and, with his humans, more than eager to be on the receiving end of scritches and scratches in all the right places. When Browder gets into mischief, scuffling with his siblings has been his favorite outlet. He meows mainly when he\u0027s hungry, then pushes his dry food around in the bowl for effect. And he shows admirable patience when his foster\u0027s 6-year-old picks him up and plays with him. Dogs are still an unknown quantity. All in all, it wouldn\u0027t take much for Browder to fit right in with any family that puts out the welcome mat for him, especially one with other cats for him to wrestle, chase and play with--even if their names are...well, you know...a little less \"interesting.\" All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip.

    "description": "Adorable, playful, shy For those of you who prefer female cat names based on a Latin gerundive, we\u0027d like you to meet a young black and white beauty named Amanda, which means \"deserving to be loved.\" Now of course, all cats deserve to be loved, even if their names don\u0027t have a cool Latin thingy to go with them. But that\u0027s all Greek to Amanda, whose primary interest so far is chasing those little toy mice around and playing with those cool wand toys. Oh, and also plenty of roughhousing with her two siblings. In spite of her name, Amanda\u0027s not what you\u0027d call a cuddler or a snuggler, at least with humans. Kinda shy that way. She will allow you to pick her up, but mainly as a means of transportation. She doesn\u0027t seem to enjoy it. She does, however, willingly curl right up with her brother and sister. So cute. Another cute thing she does is proudly carry her little stuffed mouse around from room to room. Her sibs have no idea why she does that, but if they try to take it away, she makes growling noises at them. Guess they don\u0027t understand \"cute.\" Amanda shows great patience with her foster\u0027s six-year-old son who loves to pick her up and play with her. There\u0027s also a dog in the house, but the two of them haven\u0027t been introduced yet. We think Amanda would do just fine in a family with or without other cats, but judging by her fondness for spirited play, her preference would probably be \"with.\" All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information, or to meet Amanda, please email [email protected]",

    "description": "Kiki was rescued as a wee orphan and spent the first weeks of her life alone, except for her caretakers in the APA! Nursery. Now that she is in a home with people and a foster brother, she is thriving. The first thing she learned to do was rumpus with her brother-from-another-litter; turns out she\u0027s a natural rumpus-er! Kiki has a big purr that not only communicates how happy she is, but has the added bonus of being soothing to those who hear it! Plus, petting her fur is like stroking velvet. Sit down and she will climb up to you, hoping for you to cradle her under your chin. Then she will snuggle on your neck and purr that soothing sound directly into your ear. We think that she is already an accomplished Pet Therapist! Kiki is being treated for a minor skin fungus (aka ringworm); but never fear, it\u0027s no big deal and will have no lasting effects! Kiki is great with other kittens, and respectfully hesitant around the resident adult cats in her foster home; the large dogs inspire her curiosity and pique her interest. She would love a feline buddy in her new home, though we think that even as an only kitty she would bond very quickly with her human companion. Want to see more about Kiki? Search for #kikikitten on Facebook! Contact us today to meet the amazing Kiki! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip.

    "description": "Gentle, loving, purrific! The lovely little Miss Poncho is the \"black sheep of her litter, in the best possible way! Her soft, fluffy, pure black coat is the perfect counterpoint to her lynx point sisters Pecan and Portobello. She\u0027s a calm, gentle soul who would rather curl up with you and purr than wrestle with her rowdier sisters. If they tackle her one too many times, she\u0027ll give as good as she gets, but she clearly prefers to stay above the fray. She does, however, pounce on and capture her toy mouse with great gusto! Her teeny, high-pitched \"eeeeeee! is off the Cutemeter chart. She might be a mini-mountain goat in disguise. She absolutely LOVES to climb! When given a sisal scratching post, she immediately climbed all the way up and perched on top. She also likes to just hang on the side of the post, and then drop down onto an unsuspecting sister as she walks by. One of her favorite games is \"climb the human mountain. If you sit on the floor, she\u0027ll hop onto your legs, scurry up your chest, and nuzzle your face. Then she\u0027ll hop onto your shoulder and purr in your ear. Speaking of purring, this little darling starts purring as soon as she sees you! Poncho is a neat, tidy little girl who eats her gruel without walking in it, always uses her litter box, and scratches on a cardboard scratcher. She\u0027s still so tiny that she needs a large box lid for a litter box, because she can\u0027t yet climb over the side of a regular litter box. She hasn\u0027t yet met any adult cats, dogs, or kids, but since she\u0027s naturally friendly, she\u0027d probably be fine with them given a proper introduction. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Energetic, Curious, Sweet Meet Tater Tot! Known as Tater to her friends, this playful tabby looks like a tiger, is a sweetheart, and is super fun! A bit shy at first, she quickly warms up and will then follow you everywhere. She loves laps, curling up beside you, and being held. She\u0027ll also do delicate figure eights around your legs and will lie at your feet for some great kitty company. Absolutely full of energy, this feisty girl is a master jumper and will run rings around your home in no time flat! She has recently learned to play fetch; toss a toy across the room and she will gallop over to it, grab it in her mouth, and bring it back to you. Seriously cute! Tater is very curious about things, too - quite the intrepid explorer. Her favorite toys include rubber bands, twisty ties - and sometimes your hair! She hasn\u0027t been around young children or other animals, but she got along well with some teenagers she recently met. Tater prefers serious biscuit-making over scratching. Watching her in action is so cute because of her unmatched \"socks\"...each paw has a different amount of fluffy white! If you leave Tater Tot behind, she will call out to you as if to say \"Hey, you forgot me!!\", but once she realizes she\u0027s fine, she quiets down. Check out the following link to see more of Tater Tot! https://www.instagram.com/65ritter/ Tater Tot is FeLV+ (Feline Leukemia Virus), which causes a weakened immune system and requires special care. APA! provides some medical assistance after adoption. Cats with FeLV typically have a shortened lifespan. Tater Tot is not contagious to people or dogs, but should live only with other FeLV+ cats. For more information, please contact APA! or read more by our Partner, Best Friends Animal Society: http://bestfriends.org/Resources/FAQs-About-Feline-Leukemia-Virus-FeLV If you\u0027re looking for a sweet patootie who is active, loving, and full of kitten joy, contact us today to set up a meet and greet with Tater Tot!

But, soon enough he realizes there\u0027s playing to be done and he turns into a wiggle worm ready to go. And go he does! This speedy boy can race from the top of his three story enclosure to the bottom in one second flat...a happy blur of black whizzing by!

Is this an amazing guy, or what? Smokey is best pals with his feline roommates! They are fun to watch as they play and chase each other around. He is a young cat with lots of energy, and seems to bounce around Tigger-like when he plays! To see more about Smokey, visit this Facebook page - https://www.facebook.com/NutterButtercat/ Smokey has a great purr motor! He\u0027s totally sweet. Contact us today to meet him. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Relaxed, Lovebug, Climber Pansy has beautiful orange and white tabby markings - which gives her face a rather serious look. But Pansy has a relaxed personality, not overly-serious at all! In fact, she is super awesome. Pansy loves attention and will follow you around because a) she loves you, and b) you\u0027re fascinating! She likes to keep up with what you are doing. She isn\u0027t shy about asking for some loving, and will reach out her paw to you for head scratching and belly rubbing. We think she will be a lap kitty once she is in her own home with her own people. Pansy is playful and active, too! Favorite toys: stuffed mice and jingle balls. She is a climber, so would probably make great use of cat condo in her new home. She gets excited when she sees you, hoping for either playtime or the aforementioned petting. Pansy is chill around other cats and is best buddies with her feline roommate! She would likely do well with gentle kids, too. To see more about Pansy and her friends, visit this Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/NutterButtercat/ Contact us today to meet Pansy! She is ready for you to cuddle with her and scratch her head. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip.

Once Sean gets tired of all that playing, he is an exceedingly good snuggler, and will cuddle up right next to you - or on you! So don\u0027t expect to go to bed without him right by your side. He is your buddy in all things! Sean is a big personality in a small package! He is the star of the show when a group of people visit his foster home -all eyes are on him. He knows how to work a room! Sean gets along great with all of his dog neighbors and loves to play with them. He is a super sweet, special, and energetic kitty that needs a family who will love on him and play with him. All he wants is your love and attention; seems like a reasonable request to us! Contact us today to meet this wonderful guy. Sean has tested positive for Feline Leukemia (FeLV). It is possible for kittens six months and younger to shed this virus completely and test negative, so he will be re-tested for FeLV at his six month birthday, at which time a definitive diagnosis can be assured. Until then, he should live with no other cats or kittens to ensure the virus is not passed. Sean is available for adoption now to adopters who can accommodate a feline leukemia positive, or negative, cat as he is not yet of age to have a definitive test. For more information, please contact APA! or read more by our Partner, Best Friends Animal Society: http://bestfriends.org/Resources/FAQs-About-Feline-Leukemia-Virus-FeLV Sean is one of hundreds of cats and kittens that APA! has rescued from the perils of Hurricane Harvey. Most of these kitties are up for adoption and in need of a forever home. The greatest result of a rescue is the creation of loving relationships. Share in this joy with us and adopt a cat or kitten and create your own rescue love story! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Sean, please email [email protected]",

    "description": "Playful, Observer, Chill Olive has a bit of a bashful streak - he loves to wrestle and tumble about with his feline roommates, but he prefers to play when he thinks no one is watching him! So you might think he isn\u0027t playful, but if you peek around the corner he may surprise you with an outburst of playful energy. He loves his roommates, and defers to them, letting them be in the spotlight; Olive is an easy-going guy! He just wants to get along. Olive is a handsome brown and white tabby with soulful eyes that could melt a heart. He will purr loudly when you scratch his head. Since he is quiet and mellow and likes to watch the world go on around him (he might love a high perch and/or a cat tree in a sunny spot!), his new home should probably also be quiet; kids are probably fine, as long as they are gentle around Olive and respectful of him. To see more about Olive and his friends, visit this Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/NutterButtercat/ All of the other kitties have voted, and they agree: Olive is awesome! Contact us today to meet him. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Olive, please email [email protected]",

    "description": "Gray and white and cute all over! Sasha is a beautiful gray and white kitty with bright and beautiful eyes! She is an independent woman! And such a girl! Sasha loves shoes-she loves to flop on them, brush against them, and roll all over them! Sasha takes a little while to warm up to new people, but once she gets to know you, she will rub against you and hop up on the bed for cuddles. Sasha likes her time alone. She\u0027s a pretty quiet lady who likes to be lazy around the house! Sasha is very sweet and loving and she loves to play, especially with strings! She also loves treats and will chase them across the room if you throw them for her! Sasha would do well in a home where she can be a one-person cat and still have her personal space.

    "description": "Independent, Fun, Silly With her daintily-gloved paws and her tendency to spin in a circle when she chases something, Lacy is both fancy and silly! She will chase her own tail if nothing else presents itself, but she really excels at capturing the Cat Dancer toy, as well as wrestling mouse toys and pinning them (if they could talk, they would squeak: UNCLE!). Lacy doesn\u0027t seem to be a fan of being picked up, but really gets into it when you scratch her chin, rub her cheek, and pet her while she lies close to you. She does very well with other cats, too, so would welcome a home with a feline buddy. She\u0027s been fine with the kids she has met, as long as they don\u0027t grab her or try to pick her up (as previously noted). Lacy will check out every corner of the house, sticking her delicate nose into all the nooks and crannies she can find. If there is a window, she will climb or jump up so that she can look outside and see what\u0027s happening. Then she is happy to find a cozy spot to nap; recharge; and start all over again! Lacy likes to talk to her humans, but she\u0027s not all-talk-all-the-time, and knows the value of quiet time. Lacy will make someone very happy! If she sounds perfect for you, contact us today to arrange a meet \u0026 greet. Lacy is one of hundreds of cats and kittens that APA! has rescued from the perils of Hurricane Harvey. Most of these kitties are up for adoption and in need of a forever home. The greatest result of a rescue is the creation of loving relationships. Share in this joy with us and adopt a cat or kitten and create your own rescue love story! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Lacy, please email [email protected]",

She loves to climb to the tip top of her cat tree or to the highest spot handy to get in position for a death defying pounce! She does spine tingling backflips too and will jump several feet in the air to capture her favorite wily wand toy. Hippogriff is great with other cats and kids too! Her luxurious tabby coat is super soft and she has the cutest black markings on the white fur beneath her luscious whiskers. She looks like she\u0027s drawn on a kitty moustache with a permanent marker...but it\u0027s all a part of her adorable good looks! Hippogriff has tested positive for Feline Leukemia (FeLV). It is possible for kittens six months and younger to shed this virus completely and test negative, so he will be re-tested for FeLV at his six month birthday, at which time a definitive diagnosis can be assured. Until then, he should live with no other cats or kittens to ensure the virus is not passed. Hippogriff is available for adoption now to adopters who can accommodate a feline leukemia positive, or negative, cat as she is not yet of age to have a definitive test. For more information, please contact APA! or read more by our Partner, Best Friends Animal Society: http://bestfriends.org/Resources/FAQs-About-Feline-Leukemia-Virus-FeLV Hippogriff would love to find a forever home where she can show off her impressive skills and share her loving heart each and every day!

And though she mostly prefers to curl up somewhere, she also has a bit of kitten energy. She likes to play with string and to wrestle with her feline friend, Zombie. Sasquatch is hesitant when she first meets a new cat, but she warms up. In fact, she follows Zombie around and looks for him when he\u0027s out of sight. She isn\u0027t really interested in dogs, preferring ones who ignore her. Otherwise, they get a hiss and a swat. Sasquatch has tested positive for Feline Leukemia (FeLV). It is possible for kittens six months and younger to shed this virus completely and test negative, so Sasquatch will be re-tested for FeLV at her six month birthday, at which time a definitive diagnosis can be assured.

    "description": "Super Affectionate, Super Sweet, Super! Omega is a dainty lady cat who wants to be loved! She is prim and proper, immaculately clean, and always welcomes attention and petting. In fact, she will belly flop in a decidedly non-dainty way, just to make sure you get the point that she wants her tummy rubbed. When she stands up she will head butt you, then do her trademark belly flop again. She will probably be a lap cat once she is in her new home; until then, she belly flops and head butts for attention! With her ticked tabby coat (almost like the individual hairs are striped with alternating light and dark bands), you might think Omega has Abyssinian-type markings; either way, her coat is beautiful, soft, and velvety. She has a loud purr motor and a quiet chirp. She is active and seems interested in playing with toys, but not as much as getting affection from you (cue the belly flop). She is sweet and chill and would likely do well around gentle kids and other easy-going cats. To see more about Omega and her friends, visit this Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/NutterButtercat/ Omega is looking for, wants, and deserves a loving home with loving people! Contact us today to meet this super-duper kitty companion. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Omega, please email [email protected]",

He is so affectionate and can\u0027t wait to see you, climbing up into your lap to look at you straight in the eyes. He will sit in your lap grooming and purring as long as you will have him. When it comes to play time, he is a master at hide and seek - with you or his energetic brother. They are quite a pair of rascals! He seems relaxed enough to be with dogs and kids, but he\u0027s not yet made their acquaintance. He might play a bit rough at first, but can be coaxed into a gentler mode.

    "description": "Cuddly, curious, clingy Leslie lives for your love! She\u0027s just so interested in everything you do that she always wants to be near you. If you\u0027re standing, she\u0027ll rub around your ankles and purr to ask for pets. If you\u0027re sitting at your desk, she\u0027ll lie at your feet or sit on your desk next to you, perhaps gently nudging your hand with her head. And if you\u0027re lounging on the couch or in bed, she\u0027ll purr her delight non-stop as she snuggles next to you. Love isn\u0027t a one-way street with this girl. One of the most amazing things about Leslie is that she can tell if you\u0027re sad or stressed, and if you are, she\u0027ll be right there with you to purr and cuddle your sadness away! She loves you so much that sometimes she\u0027ll gently take your finger or hand in her mouth as if she\u0027s literally trying to taste you! But don\u0027t worry - she never clamps down hard enough to hurt. Leslie enjoys gazing out the window and strolling around her home to explore her surroundings and find sweet napping and hiding spots. She rarely runs or leaps around, and she isn\u0027t really interested in toys. They\u0027re nowhere near as interesting as you are! She is pretty chatty, and will let you know if she\u0027s hungry or in need of snuggles. Leslie does have some dental problems, so she can only eat wet food. She needs to take some daily medicine, which she doesn\u0027t really like. She\u0027ll probably need to have some or all of her teeth removed in the future, and then she won\u0027t have to take that icky stuff anymore. Leslie\u0027s foster says that Leslie reminds her of Toothless from the movie How to Train Your Dragon! Leslie\u0027s ideal home would be one where someone is there most of the time to give her all the love and attention she craves. In return, she\u0027ll shower you with love and soothe you whenever you\u0027re sad or stressed. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Leslie, please email us at [email protected]",

    "description": "Social, Loving, Playful Goblin is not ghoul-like in the least--but, he will lift your spirits! This spunky, curious cutie is always ready for adventure and you\u0027re more than welcome to come along! Goblin is a social kitty who loves to be in the middle of the action and to stay abreast of the latest household activities. He\u0027s always interested in what you\u0027re doing and wants to make sure you\u0027re feeling happy, just like him! His coat is incredibly soft which is especially nice because he adores being held! He is ready for cuddles first thing in the morning and as soon as you get home from work. He gets so excited about snuggling that he may give you a little nibble. But, his foster is working on teaching him that mini kitty bites are not an appropriate way to express his enthusiasm. Goblin plays with zeal! He wrestles with the other kittens in his foster home, complete with sprints and chirps, and enjoys chasing the laser pointer and exploring boxes. He\u0027s turning out to be a water lover too and has been known to go wading in the tub and to plop toys down in his water bowl. Goblin has shown indifference to the dog in his foster home. He hasn\u0027t been around kids, but would likely to well around them if they showered him with love and attention. Goblin loves gobbling up yummy food and will do just about anything for a treat, including learning commands. He knows \"sit\", although sometimes it\u0027s so-o-o-o hard to stay put when there\u0027s a treat oh-so close! However, he\u0027ll wait it out if you tell him \"no paw\"...there\u0027s some impressive self-control! Goblin is FeLV+ (Feline Leukemia Virus), which causes a weakened immune system, but does not require much special care. APA! provides medical assistance related to the leukemia virus after adoption. Cats with FeLV typically have a shortened lifespan. Goblin is not contagious to people or dogs, but should live only with other FeLV+ cats and be inside only. For more information, please contact APA! or read more by our Partner, Best Friends Animal Society: http://bestfriends.org/Resources/FAQs-About-Feline-Leukemia-Virus-FeLV If you\u0027re ready to add an affectionate and outgoing fluff ball to your family, and a nice sprinkling of fairy dust too, Goblin is your go-to guy! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Shy, Playful, Cuddly As Shakespeare put it \"A rose by any other name would smell as sweet.\" So true of roses, people and cats! Let us introduce you to Poltergeist! This lovely kitten, by any name, is playful, cuddly and sweet! Poltergeist is reserved when she first meets you. But, with encouragement and patience, her charming personality comes out and dazzles! She loves to chase toys and pounce after the laser pointer, and she\u0027ll have you laughing at her tumbling skills. When playtime is over, she wants to hangout in your arms or cuddle up beside you. She doesn\u0027t say much, other than sometimes imploring you to hold her, but her gentle purr lets you know she\u0027s a happy girl! Poltergeist enjoys an occasional wrestling match with her kitten roomies. But, she tends to shyly stay in the background watching them play or go off and explore tranquilly on her own, often discovering yet another new place to perch and watch the world go by. Poltergeist is a stickler for a fresh and tidy litterbox and is much appreciative of regular cleanings. Poltergeist is FeLV+ (Feline Leukemia Virus), which causes a weakened immune system, but does not require much special care. APA! provides medical assistance related to the leukemia virus after adoption. Cats with FeLV typically have a shortened lifespan. Poltergeist is not contagious to people or dogs, but should live only with other FeLV+ cats and be inside only. For more information, please contact APA! or read more by our Partner, Best Friends Animal Society: http://bestfriends.org/Resources/FAQs-About-Feline-Leukemia-Virus-FeLV Poltergeist\u0027s ideal home would be a calm, quiet one with lots of nooks and crannies to explore and with a nice scratching post for luxurious kitty arm stretch, claw conditioning workouts. If you give Poltergeist the time she needs to get comfortable, you\u0027ll be rewarded with a loving, playful friend for life. And, to quote The Bard once more, you\u0027re sure to say \"I love you with so much of my heart that none is left to protest.\" Contact us to meet sweet Poltergeist today!

    "description": "Gorgeous - Playful - Loving Ghost and his siblings came all the way from North Carolina to join their APA! foster home and, so far, he\u0027s doing great. This fluffy and handsome boy is wearing his best tuxedo with matching socks and has made a great impression. A good blend of sweet and playful, Ghost has short spurts of energy in which he zooms around the house, then lay down next to you and start purring. Although he\u0027s young, he\u0027s relatively chill and doesn\u0027t have crazy kitten energy. Ghost enjoys chasing feather toys and balls and he gets along great with his brother, Ghoul. Ghost is pretty quiet most of the time. He has only been in his foster home for two weeks, but has already started to warm up to the resident dog (who scared the daylights out of Ghost at first). He\u0027s starting to show interest in socializing with the dog and will sometimes even lay next to her, though he\u0027s not comfortable playing with canines yet. His foster mom thinks he would do fine in a home with a cat-friendly dog who will respect his personal space. Ghost also likes children, but he can get a bit nibbly when playing, so older, cat-savvy kids would be best. All in all, this cat is a friendly Ghost who would do well in almost any loving home.

    "description": "Playful - Friendly - Cautious Ghoul and his siblings came all the way from North Carolina to join their APA! foster home and, so far, he\u0027s doing great. This handsome tabby boy has a sweet face and a white ascot tie (and matching socks) and has made a great impression. Ghoul is a social guy and loves to engage you for pets and cuddles. Ghoul has short spurts of energy in which he zooms around the house, then lays down next to you and start purring. Although he\u0027s young, he\u0027s relatively chill and doesn\u0027t have crazy kitten energy. Ghoul enjoys chasing strings and playing with toys; he also loves playing with his brother, Ghost. Ghoul is not a very vocal kitty and he uses his litter box well. He has only been in his foster home for two weeks, but has already started to warm up to the resident dog (who scared the daylights out of Ghoul at first). He\u0027s starting to show interest in socializing with the dog and will sometimes even share the couch with her, though he\u0027s not comfortable playing with canines yet. His foster mom thinks he would do fine in a home with a cat-friendly dog who will respect his personal space. Ghoul also likes children (he sometimes sleeps in his teenage human foster sister\u0027s bed), but he can get a bit nibbly when playing, so older, cat-savvy kids would be best. All in all, this cat is a friendly guy who would do well in almost any loving home.

    "description": "Adorable, Spunky, Affectionate. Wampus is a lovely loyal fellow, and will let you know how he feels with his loud purr as he follows you from room to room. When not on the prowl for some of your attention, he turns acrobatic, chasing down toy mice, balls, feathers and even his sister! But when the game is won, he contently will accept any treats that you might offer his way. Waiting for your affection and perhaps a \"Good Game, Wampus! as you high-five him, or place a gentle love-tap on his cute little pink nose. Wampus has that classically beautiful tabby coat and is very affectionate with his sister. He is quite the gentlemen too, as he is playful and respectful around children. He has not spent time around other cats or dogs, so that compatibility is still to be learned. If you want a lively little fellow, Wampus is ready to roar! Contact us today to meet this tantalizing tabby lad. Wampus has tested positive for Feline Leukemia (FeLV). It is possible for kittens six months and younger to shed this virus completely and test negative, so he will be re-tested for FeLV at his six month birthday, at which time a definitive diagnosis can be assured. Until then, Wampus should live with no other cats or kittens to ensure the virus is not passed. Wampus is available for adoption now to adopters who can accommodate a feline leukemia positive, or negative, cat as he is not yet of age to have a definitive test.

    "description": "Teacup started as the shy runt of the bunch but quickly made it clear that she can boldly hold her own! Her tiny meow, affectionate eyes and dainty gait don\u0027t stop her being the first to approach a dog and engage in a little one on one playtime! Maybe it\u0027s her femme-fatale tactic! She can be a little reserved or \"coy with humans at first but this predominately calico blend of the group will soon be won over with playtime or happily snuggle for affection during downtime. Teacup is one of hundreds of cats and kittens that APA! has rescued from the perils of Hurricane Harvey. Most of these kitties are up for adoption and in need of a forever home. The greatest result of a rescue is the creation of loving relationships. Share in this joy with us and adopt a cat or kitten and create your own rescue love story! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Teacup, please email [email protected]",

    "description": "Beautiful, interactive, social A lovely couple found Vampire wandering outside and kindly took her in before Harvey hit. They nursed her back to health and were going to keep her... until they discovered that she tested positive for feline leukemia. They had two FeLV negative cats and couldn\u0027t risk it with them. So they searched and searched to find a rescue for her, not willing to surrender her to a shelter where she would be euthanized, and she ended up with APA. She was obviously very well loved! Vampire is a beautiful Snowshoe Siamese girl. She has a permanent head tilt which we assume is due to an old neck injury. It makes her look even cuter than she already is! She also has a dramatic mask over her eyes and a small amount of brown around her mouth, which makes her look even more like a vampire. But the similarities end there - this Vampire is one of the sweetest, friendliest kitties you\u0027ll ever meet! When she arrived at our FeLV adoption center, she immediately fell in love with all the other cats! Some of them hissed at her, so she just ignored them and focused on making friends with the friendly ones. She had some limited experience with dogs at her previous owner\u0027s home, and enjoyed them. We don\u0027t know if she\u0027s had any experience with kids, but she\u0027s so friendly, outgoing and playful that we suspect she will do well with them. She has a quiet little meow and will talk to you if you talk to her first! If you call her name, she\u0027ll chirp and run to you! We haven\u0027t seen her climb into a lap yet, but she does LOVE to be pet! As far as she\u0027s concerned, the more attention and petting you give her, the better! She\u0027s almost kitten-like in how playful she is! She will chase her own tail if you aren\u0027t around to play with her. Vampire is looking for a forever home with a family who has lots of love to give. She would be so happy if her family is around more often than not. She would especially love to have another FeLV+ cat in their home for her to bond with, or maybe some kids who can shower her with attention. Vampire is one of hundreds of cats and kittens that APA! has rescued from the peril of Hurricane Harvey. Most of these kitties are up for adoption and in need of a forever home. That\u0027s why for the month of October, adoption fees will be waived on all APA! cats and kittens. This includes kitties of every age, in foster and at every adoption location. Vampire is FeLV+ (Feline Leukemia Virus), which causes a weakened immune system, but does not require much special care. APA! provides medical assistance related to the leukemia virus after adoption. Cats with FeLV typically have a shortened lifespan. Vampire is not contagious to people or dogs, but should live only with other FeLV+ cats and be inside only. For more information, please contact APA! or read more by our Partner, Best Friends Animal Society: http://bestfriends.org/Resources/FAQs-About-Feline-Leukemia-Virus-FeLV All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Vampire, please email us at [email protected]",

    "description": "Beautiful Windigo! Contact us today to arrange a meet \u0026 greet. Windigo has tested positive for Feline Leukemia (FeLV). It is possible for kittens six months and younger to shed this virus completely and test negative, so she will be re-tested for FeLV at her six month birthday, at which time a definitive diagnosis can be assured. Until then, she should live with no other cats or kittens to ensure the virus is not passed. Windigo is available for adoption now to adopters who can accommodate a feline leukemia positive, or negative, cat as she is not yet of age to have a definitive test. For more information, please contact APA! or read more by our Partner, Best Friends Animal Society: http://bestfriends.org/Resources/FAQs-About-Feline-Leukemia-Virus-FeLV All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Windigo, please email [email protected]",

    "description": "Stoic, Handsome, Shy Toby is an old soul. He\u0027s most content when perched up high, surveying his territory and observing the surroundings. But you\u0027ll take just as much joy in watching him as he does you! His big green eyes and gorgeous coat are really a sight to behold. And even though he\u0027s pretty shy at first and will hide away from humans and other cats, he\u0027ll eventually warm up and let you scratch him a bit before moseying over to the nearest sunny spot. Toby\u0027s been pretty well-behaved for his foster so far, and as long as he\u0027s not shut in a room for too long, he\u0027s a total good boy. He\u0027d do best in a mellow household without any rowdy pets or kids (older or calmer cats are fine). Give him free roam of the house and a big window to stare out of, and he\u0027s set! Toby has stomatitis, which is an inflammation of the mouth. It is typically resolved through removal of teeth and supportive care. He currently requires some extra medical care and a special wet food diet. For more information, please contact APA! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Davey Jones is super playful and likes to get the action started! But he knows when to take a break from the action - which he will do while snuggling in your lap. Davey Jones has tested positive for Feline Leukemia (FeLV). It is possible for kittens six months and younger to shed this virus completely and test negative, so he will be re-tested for FeLV at his six month birthday, at which time a definitive diagnosis can be assured. Until then, he should live with no other cats or kittens to ensure the virus is not passed. Davey Jones is available for adoption now to adopters who can accommodate a feline leukemia positive, or negative, cat as he is not yet of age to have a definitive test. For more information, please contact APA! or read more by our Partner, Best Friends Animal Society: http://bestfriends.org/Resources/FAQs-About-Feline-Leukemia-Virus-FeLV Contact us today to meet Davey Jones! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Quirky, Outgoing, Affectionate Clown the cat might have a silly name, but she\u0027s serious about one thing - love! She is an extremely affectionate cat, who adores receiving all the pets you\u0027ll give her. At night, she\u0027ll come and curl up on your chest. She also likes to hug your hand during snuggles, like it\u0027s her body pillow. When she\u0027s especially happy, she makes soothing coos, like a plush-coated pigeon. Clown likes to play both by herself and with humans, but isn\u0027t a manic cat. Even if she doesn\u0027t get playtime every day, she never gets too rowdy. Her favorite toy is the laser pointer - she loves to chase it around and around! Clown also likes to tell you what\u0027s on her mind, but she won\u0027t keep you up at night. She understands that night time is for snuggling. In the shelter, having other cats around stressed her out, but it\u0027s not clear if it was the cats or the shelter environment that caused her stress. Just to be safe, Clown\u0027s perfect home would be one where she\u0027s the only cat around, with people around who love having a cuddlebug for a cat. Clown is FeLV+ (Feline Leukemia Virus), which causes a weakened immune system and requires special care. APA! provides some medical assistance after adoption. Cats with FeLV typically have a shortened lifespan. Clown is not contagious to people or dogs, but should live only with other FeLV+ cats. For more information, please contact APA! or read more by our Partner, Best Friends Animal Society: http://bestfriends.org/Resources/FAQs-About-Feline-Leukemia-Virus-FeLV All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip.

    "description": "Affectionate, young-at-heart, playful Age is just a number - just ask Evelyn. You would think this spunky and playful girl is a kitten! Her personal favorite toys are crinkle balls, string toys, and catnip (obviously!). Evelyn is a special cat because she loves to be around people and close to you, but she isn\u0027t overly needy and desperate for attention. One of Evelyn\u0027s cutest quirks is her head bumps. She\u0027ll give you an adorable little nudge when she wants some love. She\u0027s also very chatty when it comes to feeding time and is almost always purring. Evelyn is super friendly, affectionate, and people-oriented! But she is stressed very easily (who can relate?); she doesn\u0027t love dogs or other cats so would likely be best as an only pet. She would be perfect for someone who wants a low-maintenance companion! If Evelyn sounds like the spunky lady you\u0027ve been searching for, don\u0027t hesitate to meet her! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Evelyn, please email [email protected]",
