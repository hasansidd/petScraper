    "description": "Content, Quiet, Special Winnie is a mellow and happy girl. She likes to watch the world go by from her window perch (aka Cat TV), to chase the laser light, and to battle string toys. She plays with other cats but prefers privacy when she takes a nap. And if you have a vacant lap, she will take up residence in it and purr! Winnie was born with Manx Syndrome, a defect that causes her to be incontinent. This means she needs a compassionate owner who will help her express her urine a few times a day; this sounds harder than it actually is, and APA! will provide instruction on how to do it. Winnie doesn\u0027t have a tail, which is totally cute, but it is also helpful in keeping her clean - she is so accommodating! Winnie has beautiful green eyes and a sweet demeanor. She must always remain an indoor cat, but she does like to bask outside in a protected, enclosed area, such as a chicken coop or a rabbit hutch (without the chickens or rabbits, of course!). If you are looking to adopt a wonderful cat who also has special needs, we think you should meet Winnie. She will completely love you back. Contact us to meet her today! All APA! cats and kittens are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Loving, Playful, Adorable Say hello to sweet little Gracie! This gorgeous girl just wants to be with you. She\u0027ll follow you around the house, even patiently sitting outside the shower. She likes to snuggle up beside you or lay by your feet. She enjoys equal parts of playtime and nap time. She bats at mice on strings and chases other toys on her own. Gracie is a special kitty with special needs. She was left incontinent after a car accident and has limited use of her back legs. Because of her condition, Gracie needs to have her bladder expressed twice a day; and since she can\u0027t quite groom her rear end, she would greatly benefit from having a monthly shave back there to prevent matting (she\u0027s such a fluffy girl!). She has few troubles with the litter box - she kicks litter and sometimes misses the box. Sometimes when you\u0027re in the bathroom, Gracie will come running so she can have her potty time, too! She knows the drill. She is a smart, willing girl who handles her differences with dignity, and she is looking for her human companion who can do the same. Gracie has not met any children or dogs, and has enjoyed being with other cats who aren\u0027t dominant and don\u0027t bully her; sometimes other cats try to bully her, which is not nice at all, especially since Gracie is such a nice girl! Because she enjoys the company of other cats, it would be great to find a home with a cat who would accept her and be her buddy. She\u0027d be the perfect cat for someone who wants a truly loving and devoted companion. This total sweetheart is waiting to meet her best friend and find her ideal forever home. If you\u0027re looking to make a huge difference in a little kitty\u0027s life, contact us today to meet Gracie. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Friendly, Sweet, Easy-Going Ms. Manners has nothing on Yotsuba! She may just be the most polite and gentle kitty you\u0027ll ever meet! She\u0027ll quietly sit next to you peacefully enjoying your company, and will courteously request pets by rolling over and putting her paws on her head. She adores gentle belly rubs and having her gorgeous orange coat brushed. Did you notice her sparkling, sea-green eyes? They\u0027re even more beautiful in person! Yotsuba is not a particularly active girl; rather than play with toys, she prefers to spend her days lounging on comfy pillows or in cozy nooks and crannies all around your home. She is not a lap cat, but will gladly plop down on your laptop or come sit right on you in hopes of getting some nice scratches, she can\u0027t get enough of those! Yotsuba has been frightened by dogs she has met. We don\u0027t know how she is around cats. Given her tolerant temperament, she would likely be fine with respectful children. Yotsuba has diabetes, so she requires some extra medical care which may include a regulated diet and/or insulin. You can contact APA! for additional information on caring for a diabetic kitty. Yotsuba also has stomatitis which is an inflammation of the mouth and gums. APA! can provide you with details about this condition. Yotsuba is very cooperative when it comes to taking her medication which makes this precious gem all the more endearing! She is front declawed, so she would need to be an indoor only cat. Yotsuba is the sweetest furry friend imaginable! She would make a fantastic companion cat for someone who is looking for a calm, extremely considerate and affectionate kitty. She needs a kindhearted person who is comfortable giving her medication. In return, she will make you smile each day with her laid-back temperament and her unconditional love. If you would like to meet precious Yotsuba, contact APA today! All APA! cats and kittens are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip.

    "description": "Friendly, Cuddler, Precious They don\u0027t call this kitty O\u0027Purry for nothing! This sweetheart adores cuddling in your lap and purring away. O\u0027Purry has some special needs that make her different than your typical cat. But, her desire for affection and love are the same as any people-loving kitty as well as her happy purr. Being different doesn\u0027t matter to O\u0027Purry, but being loved most certainly does. O\u0027Purry has a condition that is called Manx Syndrome. This means she was born without a tail and a shorter spine than most cats which has caused her to be fecally incontinent, and she also needs her bladder expressed a couple of times a day -- we know that sounds scary, but don\u0027t worry! Her foster and our vets will walk you through how to care for O\u0027Purry and her special needs. O\u0027Purry is easy to express and has no problems as long as you express her regularly (morning, lunch, after work and before bed). She will probably have to wear a diaper her entire life, but she doesn\u0027t let that stop her. She is a brave kitty, takes all of this all in stride, and still plays like a happy, confident kitten! O\u0027Purry, because of her shortened spine, also walks a bit differently than other cats. She gets around just fine, and is cute as a button! She moves more like a rabbit than a cat and can be heard hopping around from downstairs. She is able to climb up a cat tree but has to work hard to jump up on a chair. She loves to play with balls and mice and likes other cats. When O\u0027Purry finishes her kitty games, she will seek out your lap to sit and then the o\u0027purry sets in and she purrs and purrs with delight! Caring for a special needs pet may take less time and money than you think... and the life you\u0027ll save is priceless along with the love that you\u0027ll receive. Contact APA! to find out more about O\u0027Purry and to set up a meet and greet with the purriest of kitties today! All APA! kittens are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

He is affectionate with all people and loves to be petted. In fact, he will tap you on the arm to request for you to pet him! He also will give you nose kisses - touch his nose gently and sweetly to yours - to let you know how much he loves you. Super sweet and loving! Holly George has Manx Syndrome; basically, the gene that gave him his short tail also shortened his spine, which caused him to be incontinent and unable to pee on his own. This is where you come in! His human needs to \"express - apply light pressure in a particular way - Holly George\u0027s bladder a few times a day to help him urinate. For more information, please contact APA! In addition to people, Holly George is social with other cats, too, and would love to have a feline buddy (or two) to hang out with in his new home. He has grown up around cats of all ages and accepts all of them. He will snuggle with them and groom them, and he will play with them, too! He also likes a variety of toys - balls, string toys, feather toys - and a scratching post to scratch and climb. He is young and active! Holly George has some special needs, and we think the perfect home for him is with patient people who will love and appreciate him! His human companion should be able to express his bladder and keep him clean (he is a little sensitive around his back end, so he likes to be handled gently); other than that, all Holly George needs is company, love and affection, and to be played with. He would be best with adults and young adults, rather than little kids. Though Holly George is friendly and outgoing, he likely will need time to adapt to his new home and family. But once he is comfortable, we think you will agree that he is an over-the-top wonderful cat! Contact us today for more information, and to set up a meet and greet.

She won\u0027t settle into your lap for petting, but she definitely loves for you to pet her! She does well with children, and would probably prefer a home with a family who was around more often than not; she is independent, but she appreciates attention and company. Stacy loves humans, but is not a fan of other cats, so would do best as the only feline in the home. Stacy is FeLV+ (Feline Leukemia Virus), which causes a weakened immune system and requires special care. APA! provides some medical assistance after adoption. Cats with FeLV typically have a shortened lifespan. Stacy is not contagious to people or dogs, but should live only with other FeLV+ cats. For more information, please contact APA! or read more by our partner, Best Friends Animal Society: http://bestfriends.org/Resources/FAQs-About-Feline-Leukemia-Virus-FeLV/ Stacy makes the cutest purr-chirp sound when she wants your attention; for example, when she is looking for interaction with you or if her food dish is empty. You have to hear it for yourself - there aren\u0027t the right letters in the alphabet to spell it! Stacy will make someone a great companion cat, so contact us today if she sounds perfect for you!

    "description": "Are you looking for a spitfire companion full of sass? Do you have a soft spot for heartthrobs with checkered pasts? Would you like to take a walk on the wild side? Then meet Boris, Austin\u0027s very own beautiful bad boy with a heart of gold! Like most bad boys, Boris has had a few run-ins with the law; when you look deeper, though, you can easily get past the naughty exterior to see his perspective. Before he came to APA!, Boris had the misfortune of having his front paws declawed, and he\u0027s understandably upset about this turn of events. Without his claws, Boris can\u0027t defend himself the same way that other cats can. The world is a lot scarier when you feel helpless, and poor Boris suffers from some anxiety problems that cause him to lash out using the only defense he has left- his teeth. Boris does have a bite history, and will need a compassionate adopter who is willing to look past his bad habits. In return, however, Boris will reveal his heart of gold and reward his family with all of the love, snuggles, and head butts anyone could ask for. At heart, this bad boy is really a snuggle bug, who loves to be pet, scratched, and brushed, and who will even put his paws on your shoulders to give you a hug! Boris is a staff favorite at APA!, and many of the cat program counselors have fallen in love with him as he climbed on their shoulders or took a snooze on their laps. Funny and quirky, this boy loves to take the spotlight with his playful antics. He can often be found chasing balls around his enclosure, wrestling with his roommates, or stealing all the attention of anyone who comes to visit. Boris, with his dreamy fluffy white fur and striking splashes of orange tabby stripes, knows that he deserves the spotlight, and will demand it! Boris does well with other cats in the shelter, but needs to be in an animal-free home - he wants to be the center of your attention. Boris is absolutely not interested in kids of any species! This bachelor is childfree for life and proud of it, and will not be adopted to a home with children. Because of his struggles with fear-based aggression, he takes an easy once-daily anxiety medication that has helped him enormously. On the medication, Boris is much more comfortable with the world around him and much more able to be the sweetheart we know he is inside. What Boris really needs, however, is someone in his corner who will be patient and compassionate, who will protect him and make him feel comfortable and loved, and who will act as his advocate to the world and understand his needs. If this sounds like you, come meet Boris today! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Boris, please email [email protected]",

    "description": "Quiet, Calm, Couch-potato Is there a new series on Netflix you\u0027ve been itching to binge with a couch companion? Look no further than Shasta to keep you company! Shasta is as chill as it gets. Her favorite pastime is curling up next to you on a couch getting some head rubs - she enjoys life\u0027s simple pleasures. Shasta is a pretty low-maintenance and chill kitty aside from her special food. She isn\u0027t super active nor is she very chatty - calm, cool, and collected. Since Shasta is a mature lady, she would probably prefer a relaxed home with older, polite kids if any. If Shasta sounds like the missing piece to your family, don\u0027t hesitate to meet her! Shasta has diabetes and requires some extra medical care, which may include regulated diet and/or insulin. For more information, please contact APA!

    "description": "Purr-Master, Sweetheart, Snuggler There\u0027s no doubt that George Ezra\u0027s charming personality and quirky kitty ways would inspire his human namesake to sing a song about him. There\u0027s just something about a vibrant orange fluffball happily climbing into your lap, kneading away and drifting off to sleep that makes you feel all cozy and...well...that just makes you want to sing! George not only adores people, he loves playing with other cats and to snuggle and get baths from them. He also enjoys gazing out the window with a kitty friend by his side. He has a wonderful purr and is just as content snuggling and sleeping as he is playing. When George does play, he loves a go-round with a rascally string toy or trying to take down those pesky laser pointers! George is FeLV+ (Feline Leukemia Virus), which causes a weakened immune system and requires special care. APA! provides some medical assistance after adoption. Cats with FeLV typically have a shortened lifespan. George is not contagious to people or dogs, but should live only with other FeLV+ cats. For more information, please contact APA! or read more by our Partner, Best Friends Animal Society: http://bestfriends.org/Resources/FAQs-About-Feline-Leukemia-Virus-FeLV/ George is under the weather sometimes and takes medication that helps him feel better. He is such a lovebug, you won\u0027t find a sweeter cat! This little fellow also has impeccable manners, always using his litterbox and only scratching his toys, not the furniture! George would absolutely thrive in a loving home where a lap or two is readily available and with human friends who are comfortable giving him the medical care he needs to keep this precious guy as healthy as possible. Young kids may be a bit much for him, but gentle older children and adults would most certainly keep his purr motor going strong. Contact APA! today to meet this orange delight! All APA! kittens are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Calm - Friendly - Happy Mia is a beautiful black and golden tortie. She\u0027s a senior gal who is more interested in naps and pets than in racing about the house and bouncing off walls. She can be a little shy at first, but once she has gotten to know you, you could not ask for a more affectionate cat. She loves to be curled up by your side while you watch Netflix, or read a good book, or play X-box. Mia loves attention, and would love a home where her special people are home a lot to give her the affection she craves. She would be the perfect fit for a housebound senior, or a young professional who has a home office! Or a homemaker who will let her sit at their side as they take care of their house. Mia has Chronic Renal Disease, which means her kidneys are not functioning as well as they once were. This condition is so common in older cats that APA! offers a special adoption package for them. Read more about renal failure and adoption details here: http://www.austinpetsalive.org/2016/03/lives-worth-saving-cats-in-renal-failure We can tell you this: it will be well worth the extra care to have this sweet face greet you at the door every day. Mia gets along fine with the other cats in the cattery, so would do well with a calm feline companion with a similar low-key activity level. Or she could flourish as an only cat, and keep all your attention for herself! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip.

    "description": "Curious, Affectionate, Patient If you are looking for a cat overflowing with personality, Hector can deliver that - and more! When Hector first goes home with you, he will probably hide for a bit, so be gentle and patient with him. He doesn\u0027t mind if you seek him out in his safe hidey-hole; he will accept your petting! This is how you prove to him that you are a trustworthy human (we suspect people in his previous life were not trustworthy or dependable). And once he trusts you, he will seek YOU out for petting; he may even be a little pushy about it! Eventually, he will become your total lap cat. And not only that! When Hector relaxes and is comfortable in his new home, he will purr constantly! If he is not in your lap, he is content to sit across the room from you, gazing at you with love, making little cooing sounds at you. How cute is that!? Hector knows his name and will respond when you call him. He is mostly a mellow guy, but just when you think you have defined him, he will change it up; he may run around the house, chasing who-knows-what, playfully throwing his toys around, jumping up on things to get a better view of his domain! Hector has an ulcer on his tongue that makes it look like he is sticking his tongue out. We don\u0027t know if it is due to genetics, his immune system, or allergies; it is stubborn to completely heal, so a biopsy will be done to figure out what it is and what can be done to get it to heal. Hector is a healthy FIV+ (Feline Immunodeficiency Virus) cat. FIV+ cats typically live long, healthy lives! For more information, please contact APA! or read this FAQ: http://bestfriends.org/Resources/FAQs-About-Feline-Immunodeficiency-Virus-FIV Hector needs a low-traffic home with patient, cat-experienced adults. He seems interested in other cats, but we don\u0027t know how he interacts with them. He has good scratching habits and would do best with a large litter box, or even one with a cover. Hector is quirky and loving and talkative, quite simply a GREAT cat! He loves his people once you get through that getting-to-know-you period. He is alert, curious, and inquisitive. And fabulous and silly! We could go on and on, but contact us to meet him for yourself! Your cup will runneth over. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Friendly, Calm, Easy-going Minerva is a relaxed, friendly, and great companion who is always happy to see you! She will spend as much time as possible sitting next to you, and prefers that to sitting in your lap (though she doesn\u0027t mind being picked up). She loves pets and will even let you rub her tummy and feet. She will follow you around for attention and affection, may lick your knees or feet, and then will rub her face on them! Hint, hint: she loves you. When Minerva is hungry or wants affection she meows or makes a cute chirping sound, but otherwise she is quiet. She is not crazy-playful, but will stalk, chase, and pounce on mouse-string toys and feather toys. So far, other toys don\u0027t hold that kind of interest for her, but you might discover other ones that do. Typically, she won\u0027t jump up to high places, but if you are eating food on a low coffee table, beware: she is not shy about trying to steal it from you! Minerva was underweight when rescued, and though she is gaining weight, she will likely remain a petite cat. Like many people, Minerva is taking medicine for hyperthyroidism, but takes it like a champ. She is a beautiful tabby with cute eyes ringed in black and a white chin. And she has teeny-tiny paws! She has not interacted with kids or dogs, and has kept her distance from the resident adult cat in her foster home. The ideal home for Minerva would be with adults or teens, preferably with people who work from home or are at home much of the time; we think it wouldn\u0027t suit her to be alone all day, every day. A home with low-key pets would likely be fine, with a slow and proper introduction. Minerva is in good health for an older kitty. She does take medicine for hyperthyroidism, we can show you how to give it to her. In a rather unusual twist for a cat, Minerva is a very deep sleeper! She likes to have her own comfy bed to nap in when she\u0027s not keeping you company. If Minerva sounds like the perfect doll for you, contact us today to meet her! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Minerva, please email [email protected]",

    "description": "Affectionate, Sweet, Regal Muffin is a love muffin! She needs a little time to warm up to you, but once she does she will be looking to give \"rubby-rubs to her humans and will happily accept a good ear and chin rub in return. When you get home she will greet you at the door and she will guard your bed with every inch of her body when you\u0027re sleeping. This lovely senior lady really knows how to make you feel special! Muffin is low-maintenance and is very energetic for a cat her age. She loves to play, especially with her favorite toy which is simple, yet so entertaining...a good ol\u0027 piece of string. She could give much younger cats lessons in proper string pouncing--none of that on the floor stuff, she catches hers while it\u0027s still up in the air! Muffin doesn\u0027t scratch on furniture and is a pro at using the litter box. She\u0027s quiet most of the time, but will start talking when she gets hungry. When it comes to being petted, she doesn\u0027t like for you to try and pet her from an angle she can\u0027t see and would prefer that you don\u0027t touch her pretty tortie tail. But, she is happy to accept love from you, as long as it\u0027s given on her terms! The ideal home for Muffin would include a patient adopter who is willing to give her time to acclimate to her new surroundings. Muffin would be comfortable with older kids who give her the space she needs, but younger children would be a bit much for this old gal. Muffin isn\u0027t happy when she sees the other cats in her foster home. So, she may have been the only kitty in her previous household and would likely do best as the solo cat. A low-energy dog would probably be fine if a slow introduction is made. Give Muffin the love and understanding she needs and she\u0027ll spend the rest of her life returning the favor tenfold to her most special and adored person...you! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Affectionate, Purr Master, Love Bug You will develop a big crush on Orange Crush when you meet him, which is appropriate because he is a big boy - and there is a lot to crush on! He isn\u0027t fat, just a big ol\u0027 boy - and kind of a baby, too, because he loves to be petted so much that he will cry for you to pet him! His sweet, expressive face matches his demonstrative and loving personality. He loves to be loved by you, and would rather be in the same room with you than hanging out by himself, but he does lounge around on his own, too. When Orange Crush has a burst of energy, he gets his game on with toy balls and crinkle toys! Even though he is a gentle guy, he does like to be alpha kitty when other cats are around; as long as they are cool with that, everyone gets along fine. We think he would be fine as an only cat, too, because then he would be your one \u0026 only! Orange Crush has also been around dogs in his foster home and behaved beautifully with them. Orange Crush is FeLV+ (Feline Leukemia Virus), which causes a weakened immune system and requires special care. APA! provides some medical assistance after adoption. Cats with FeLV typically have a shortened lifespan. He is not contagious to people or dogs, but should live only with other FeLV+ cats. For more information, please contact APA! or read more by our Partner, Best Friends Animal Society: http://bestfriends.org/Resources/FAQs-About-Feline-Leukemia-Virus-FeLV Orange Crush is mellow, has a cute face, and is a great companion! Contact us today to meet this darling. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Sweet, Senior, Social We can\u0027t tell you about Anderson\u0027s past because she was found as a stray by a Good Samaritan, but we can tell you that she is a sweet old girl! She may look big and tough in her photo, but she\u0027s actually petite. When Anderson first came to APA!, she was purring so loudly that the technicians giving her a physical couldn\u0027t hear her heartbeat! She is appreciative of the attention she receives, and will quietly lean into you for more pets. She is social and likes to be around people. Anderson likes being petted on her head, but prefers that you don\u0027t touch her legs or tail. She will lick you and give you kitty kisses, though sometimes the kisses turn into love nips - all the while purring! Then she will lick you again. Finally, she will sit in your lap, again with her trademark purring; which seems to get louder, the happier she is. She does all this to show you that she has accepted you as her special human companion. Anderson is good with other cats that leave her alone, so she should be be able to live with another cat, as long as they respect her and don\u0027t bully her. Because of her love nips, little kids should be supervised around her, but she should be fine with older kids who understand and appreciate her quirks. Don\u0027t think that because of her age that Anderson isn\u0027t playful, because she would prove you wrong! Stick toys are her favorite. She will do her version of running after it (walking quickly), bat it around, pounce on it, bite it, and subdue it. Anderson also gets very excited about wet food and treats! She has perfect litter box habits, though she needs a large box with high sides and/or a cover, because she will hang her hiney over the box - crouching is hard for her, so this will keep her inside the box and accident-free. So we don\u0027t know what kind of life Anderson had before, but we know for sure the remainder of her life should be with people who would love an older-yet-still-spunky cat as their feline companion. Contact us today to set up a meet and greet with this lovely senior! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Anderson, please email [email protected]",

He meows when he wants to tell you something - usually that he is hungry! Sherlock seems to chase the sun around his foster home - he loves to take a nap in the warm sun. Sherlock really loves people and likes to spend the majority of his time in the company of humans. He is a really sweet guy who loves human affection. He purrs and cuddles and makes biscuits. He\u0027ll even give an affectionate head-butt when he wants pets. Sherlock is a mature kitty so he doesn\u0027t play with toys so much, but he still gets around like a pro. His behavior with other cats, dogs, and children is unknown but he would likely do just fine with polite, respectful furry friends. If you\u0027re looking for a couch buddy to keep you company - look no further than Sherlock. Previous to his stay with APA!, Sherlock had been declawed. As a result of this he must remain an indoor cat. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

He will step all over your tummy or laptop, if you\u0027re working, to get your attention. But he is super sweet and gentle about it! Hayden is a handsome fellow, always dressed to the nines in a tasteful gray tux. You can tell he\u0027s got the Emily Post manners thing down, because he uses the litter box like a gent, and he minds the furniture as well. Right-o! Hayden has diabetes and requires some extra medical care, which may include regulated diet and/or insulin. For more information, please contact APA! But he is splendid about taking his medicine. No fuss at all. That would be bad form. He is rather enthusiastic about food, which is probably caused by the diabetes; but of course he is polite and well-behaved about it. And he\u0027s an affectionate cuddler. If he could talk, he\u0027d probably recite a bit of Shelley or Byron while lounging in your lap. His ideal home would be with someone who would love him and give him affection. He would do likely be fine with other pets, and even kids.

    "description": "Shy, Pretty, Quiet Grace can be a scaredy cat in a new environment. She has all the makings of a friendly girl, but she finds the shelter a frightening place and will tuck herself into a corner for comfort. When you see her beautiful, yellow eyes peering up at you from her hideaway, you will want to reassure her that you will take care of her, and that everything is going to work out just fine! Grace can bond with other cats; as a matter of fact, she kind of wants to mother them! So her ideal friend would be a low-key buddy - someone who wouldn\u0027t mind her fussing over them and taking care of them. We think Grace would do best with this kind of companion rather than as an only kitty. You will need to give Grace time to feel comfortable around you and her new home, and patiently give her time to trust. If you don\u0027t feel like you have the patience and time to let Grace come around on her own schedule, then this beautiful girl is not the kitty for you! We believe she has the potential to graciously, gratefully, and gracefully come out of her shell and embrace her new life - and what a reward that will be for her human companion. Grace needs someone who is committed to her for the long run, and she will do the same for you. If you can give Grace the kindness, security, and love that she needs, contact us today to arrange a meet \u0026 greet! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Mellow, Sweet, Calm Being a senior cat, Ginger would be the perfect companion cat for an older couple! She is mellow and tranquil. She might playfully bat at your pen now and then, but after that will have to take a nap. Her ideal home would be quiet and low-key. She doesn\u0027t need to sit in your lap, but she does appreciate being scratched and petted. When she\u0027s had enough, she will push your hand away. Okay, got it, Ginger! Smart girl. Previous to her stay with APA!, Ginger had been declawed. As a result of this she must remain an indoor cat. Which makes perfect sense, because what she wants is to quietly lounge around the house. She mostly ignores the other cats she has met, and we think she\u0027d be okay with older kids who respected her age and activity level. When she gets stressed out she may over groom herself, which is her way of saying, please lower the stress! So a home with rambunctious dogs would not be a good fit. Ginger is a dainty, little old lady with good litter manners. She is an easy cat to live with and to love. If you are looking for this kind of sweetness in your life, contact us today to arrange a meet \u0026 greet! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Beautiful, Reserved, Polite Unlike her namesake, Pinky Tuscadero is a well-behaved, easy-going gal! She uses the litter box perfectly and has appropriate scratching behavior. Previous to her stay with APA!, Pinky had been front and back declawed. As a result of this she must remain an indoor cat. Pinky will meow to let you know she wants food or treats, and then will wait patiently. She is in a foster home with two cats and a small, mellow dog, and will politely wait for food until it is her turn. She is smart and kindly! Pinky doesn\u0027t play with toys, but she does appreciate some good petting, scratching, and rubbing! She is tall and lean with beautiful brown and gold tortoiseshell markings. Pinky has diabetes and requires some extra medical care, which may include regulated diet and/or insulin; right now her diabetes is controlled with her diet. For more information, please contact APA! Pinky would do well in a home with other adult cats and teenagers; it takes her a while to warm up to young kids, and since she is demure and reserved, she would be a perfect companion for older humans. Pinky is precious! Contact us today to meet your new best friend. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Pinky Tuscadero, please email [email protected]",

    "description": "Star reminds us of Norma Desmond in Sunset Boulevard! Once a gorgeous young starlet, she\u0027s now a Grande Dame of a certain age. Star loves people, and she\u0027s very trusting of them. She loves to be petted and brushed while she sits right next to you. She\u0027ll even hold out her front paws so you can brush the undersides! She\u0027s sweet, and has impeccable manners. She clearly was once well cared for. We don\u0027t know how she fell on hard times. She came to us rail-thin and a bit scruffy around the edges. She\u0027s so light that, when you pick her up, it\u0027s like holding a colorful cloud! Now that she\u0027s in a loving foster home, she\u0027s doing her best to regain her former glory. This little lady can pack it in! She\u0027s otherwise quiet, but when she\u0027s hungry (again), she will tell you with her loudest meow. She especially loves real meat. Just give her some turkey and listen to her purr! She\u0027s already regained some weight, and is looking and feeling better every day. Star is quite the lounge queen. She snoozes a lot, though she\u0027ll occasionally get up and drift grandly around the house to check on things and get a snack. You can sometimes get her to take a swipe at a toy, but she quickly gets bored with that. Like any grand lady, Star is indifferent to blustering and threats from her fellow rabble-rousing foster cats. They quickly realized that she won\u0027t stoop to argue with them, so they gave up and now everyone gets along. Star is also accepting of the large friendly dog in her foster home. If you\u0027re looking for a sweet, beautiful, undemanding companion, Star might be right for you! We think she would fit well into any home that can offer her lots of companionship - and food! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Curious, Docile, Loving If you are looking to love a unique cat and can accept his disabilities as part of his charm - and give him the care he requires - Dexter is the cat for you! Dexter had to have one eye removed and has limited vision in the remaining eye, has shortened front legs that affect his mobility and the way he walks, and has an occasional seizure. If you couldn\u0027t already guess, Dexter has had a hard life - he wasn\u0027t treated well and didn\u0027t get the medical care he needed. The good news - the great news! - is that Dexter is an affectionate, social, and relaxed guy. He\u0027s actually pretty low-maintenance now that his medical issues have been addressed. Because of his short legs he can\u0027t climb into a litter box - balancing in litter is hard for him, too - but he\u0027s been successful using pee pads (he prefers his pee pad to be in a non-carpeted location). Sometimes he doesn\u0027t make it there in time, but it\u0027s not because he isn\u0027t trying. His human companion needs to be okay with this. Dexter will meow when he wants dinner and will follow you around; he has a wobbly, stumbly walk that is endearing and comical. Being close to you is important to him, so you can expect that he will lie on the floor at your feet, waiting patiently for you to pet him. He especially likes for you to pet him around his face and tail; rub his face, and he will lick you. He doesn\u0027t care for being picked up (it makes him nervous), and prefers to get his petting on the floor. Dexter doesn\u0027t play much, but that might change as he gets used to you and his new home; recently, he has been seen \"running\" (his version of running) from room-to-room in his foster home, so his foster family is planning to encourage him in some gentle games. He will move around the house to drink water, eat food, and use the pee pad, but otherwise he likes to find a comfy spot and hang out there all day, grooming himself now and then. Dexter lives with a dog in his foster home, and will sleep as close to him as he can (within six inches)! He probably wouldn\u0027t like a home with a very active dog, but he is cool with a cat-friendly, mellow pup. Similarly, Dexter is not the companion for a child. He lived with other cats in his previous life (though we don\u0027t know how they got along), but he seems fine and dandy as the only cat. Dexter is not the cat for you if you are not cat-experienced and able to love him and accommodate his special needs. His home should not have any stairs, since he can\u0027t navigate them and doesn\u0027t want to be carried around. He embodies courage and determination, maneuvering around despite his disabilities. He is relaxed and adorable, and just wants to live a comfortable life. If you can provide this for him, he will love you forever and leave a little paw print on your heart, every day. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Dexter, please email [email protected]",

    "description": "Meet Merlin: he\u0027s 7 pounds of pure Tuxedo cat magic, and he\u0027s ready to cast a spell on you. Merlin craves affection, and defies all those aloof feline stereotypes. He will lie blissfully in your arms, gazing up at you with his enchanting green eyes. And at night, he will cuddle against you as he drifts off into kitty dreamland. Not only does Merlin love people, he also exhibits zero fear of the easy-going, 60-lb dog in his foster home. He has even started to copy the actions and behavior of his best canine buddy. Maybe he\u0027s working on his shapeshifting powers? Either way, Merlin seems to have taken quite a liking to his canine roommate! He seems interested in his foster\u0027s resident cat too, though she\u0027s not so sure about him so far. You can\u0027t charm \u0027em all! Merlin had a rough start to life before coming to his current foster, but that hasn\u0027t changed his good nature. He suffered from a broken tail and a neurological injury, which mostly make him extra excited and chatty at mealtimes, and a little sensitive about the touching of his hindquarters. But can you blame a guy? None of this slows him down though, and he\u0027s a master feather wand hunter to boot. Merlin would do best in a home with a cat-experienced adult or adults, with plenty of soft surfaces for this special guy. A little bit of love and affection goes a long way, and we feel that Merlin will truly shine with the right family. If you\u0027re seeking years of conjured up purrs, tender paw taps, and lots of love (without the need for a love potion), Merlin may be the perfect cat for you. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Merlin, please email [email protected]",

    "description": "Social, Lovable, Affectionate When Doug was rescued as a stray, he was dragging his legs due to a broken pelvis; today he\u0027s healing nicely and strengthening his hind legs. And his favorite way to strengthen his legs? Following you around the house. Pressing up against you when you stand still or sit down. Jumping up to snuggle with you and sleep next to you. Where you are is where he likes to be, and he will use his crackly meow to ask for pets. Yep, the prescription for Doug\u0027s recovery is LOVE! At first, Doug was fearful and defensive in his new foster home environment. Now? Well, now he is an amazing, social cat who wants to be in the middle of everything, especially when people come to visit - because that\u0027s more people to love! He can be a little choosy about where you scratch him, but it\u0027s an easy adjustment and doesn\u0027t cause any drama. He prefers head and cheek scratches and chin scritches, and will make a silly, blissful face to show how much he approves! Doug plays with the resident younger cat and is easily tolerant with the resident grumpy, older cat. He is pretty chill, but will play with the feather wand toy. He hasn\u0027t met any children, but we recommend older kids only. He is super nervous around the resident dog, however, especially when she invades his personal boundaries, gets in his face, or acts crazy-excited. These are things Doug does NOT like, though we think he would learn to coexist just fine with a calm, relaxed, cat-respectful dog. Doug is a healthy FIV+ (Feline Immunodeficiency Virus) cat. FIV+ cats typically live long, healthy lives! For more information, please contact APA! or read this FAQ: http://bestfriends.org/Resources/FAQs-About-Feline-Immunodeficiency-Virus-FIV Doug is loving his life as a companion cat! Are you ready to have your heart stolen by a sweet, older man-cat? If so, contact us today to arrange a meet and greet. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Shy, Curious, Playful Chulo is a beautiful, jet black senior kitty with bright green eyes! She is looking for a patient and kind human to help her come out of her shell; the key to her heart is gentle petting and lots of love. Chulo spent her life in a loving home with other cats and dogs, but sadly, her human passed away, and Chulo\u0027s life completely changed. She is understandably nervous about new places and people since leaving her home. When you meet her, it might be on her terms; she may have found a safe place to hide for a while - like under a bed - until she feels safe and comfortable. But she doesn\u0027t mind if you pet her while she rests in her hidey-hole! Chulo has a strong, happy purr and can be quite affectionate with people she trusts. She is very polite, uses her litterbox consistently, plays with toys, and takes advantage of scratching posts instead of furniture. Chulo is a sweet kitty who\u0027s ready to settle in to her forever home! She would do best in a quiet, low-traffic home and would probably mesh well with other easy-going cats (she\u0027s doing great with the younger cat who is sharing her foster home!), and maybe even a cat-friendly dog. She takes a while to warm up, but if you\u0027re patient she\u0027ll reward you with plenty of purrs! Contact us today to arrange a meet and greet with Chulo. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Gentle, Sweet, Beautiful Marlena is a beautiful calico cat with very soft fur, eyes that are a lovely shade of green and she has really cute facial expressions. She is a very sweet and gentle dignified older lady who is a little shy at first. With time and patience she comes out of her shell and is very friendly. She likes to sit next to her foster mom and \"helps\" when she is working on her laptop. She is a cuddly sleeper and will give a big purr when she gets petted. She is not particularly playful but does enjoy a little play with a catnip toy from time to time and really loves and needs some sort of scratching post/board. For the most part, she likes to take it easy but meal time and treat time get her super excited. She generally doesn\u0027t like other cats but is not aggressive when she gets to know them. It is unknown how she would feel about dogs or children but all indications are she would not be a fan. She would probably prefer a home when she gets to be the only pet and queen of the castle. Marlena has diabetes and was left at the shelter due to the diagnosis. She just needs a quite home with loving humans who can give her a little special attention and love. She requires some extra medical care which includes a regulated diet and insulin injections along with monitoring. She appears to have some limited vision which is customary for diabetic cats. For more information, please contact APA! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

It was shortly discovered that she was not pregnant but instead had a huge belly from fluid build up secondary to not enough protein in her diet. Since she got here, she has been treated for mange and is loving and friendly. A little too friendly because she love bites when excited:) She would make a great cat in a dog free home. She is terrified of dogs. She is being treated for mange and will go home with meds to finish that up. The mange is only contagious to other cats, not dogs or people so she is safe to take now. She has beautiful green eyes and when her whiskers and fur completely grows back, she will be a looker! Can you give her a place to call home?",

    "description": "Playful, sweet, friendly Any self respecting cat has a favorite toy they love to chase. You know: String, feathered. Balls, jingly. Mouse, catnip. But for this two-year-old calico, the preference is: Tail, Sally\u0027s. Yep, Sally\u0027s her name, her tail is her game. Not that she won\u0027t chase anything else, including other cats, but it\u0027s so much easier when that elusive plaything is built right in. As if to highlight this special relationship, Sally\u0027s main calico marking is...her tail. The rest of her is white, white and more white. She\u0027s is a striking lass. She\u0027s also fastidious and clearly appreciates a clean litter box. If it isn\u0027t up to snuff, she might leave you a message on the outside of the box. Having recently discovered that her scratching posts can be every bit as satisfying as that rug over there, she is still transitioning from the one to the other. Sally does require daily medication to control seizures from idiopathic (having no specific cause) epilepsy. Apart from that she\u0027s as healthy as a cat-size horse. Dogs and children are still a question mark in Sally\u0027s life, but because she\u0027s so playful with other cats, while being respectful of their boundaries, we suspect she\u0027d do well with similarly inclined housemates of any species. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Sweet, sometimes dorky, languorous Munchkin is content to lie as close to you as humanly (or felinely) possible and napping for a good long time, while reserving the right to be lovingly stroked and/or brushed, also for a good long time. She loves to be petted for as long as your hand can last (she always wins that game), and will purrrrrrr to let you know you\u0027re doing it \"right\". She will even lick your hand a little, grooming you as a reward for giving her pets. She is a beautiful, soft, fluffy, cuddly brown tortie, so petting her is a reward in itself. While some cats like to be busy exploring, playing, chasing, leaping, etc., that best describes Munchkin\u0027s past rather than her present. She\u0027s probably had enough fun, chased enough jingly balls and leapt upon enough devious laser dots to last a lifetime. Fifteen years, to be exact. She\u0027s earned a rest. Being the mild-mannered sweetheart that she is, Munchkin doesn\u0027t much care for excitable cats or dogs, and children would likely overwhelm her. Munchkin is looking to be the only pet in a quiet home where she can be doted on as she deserves! Previous to her stay with APA!, Munchkin\u0027s front paws had been declawed. As a result of this, she must remain an indoor cat. Munchkin does have some arthritis in her spine, which can cause discomfort and difficulty getting around, but she\u0027s now on medication for it and is feeling better. She is showing some signs of early-stage kidney issues, but with a proper diet and treatment, she may well have years of cuddling left! Hey, we all get a little creaky as we get older, but we also start to realize there\u0027s nothing better than loving and being loved! And loving you is just what Munchkin wants to spend her life doing! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Munchkin, please email us at [email protected]",

    "description": "Quiet, stoic, contemplative If Caren can be adopted into a welcoming home with no children (possibly with a second animal, quiet and low-key, that will respect her boundaries) we\u0027re hopeful that the passage of time, combined with the kind and patient attention of her human caregivers, will begin to ease the apprehension she feels in a new and unfamiliar environment. A one-year-old tabby with a beautiful, smooth coat, Caren (with a \"C\"-kind of like Cate with a \"C\" Blanchett) will present a challenge for her adoptive home. As a socialization foster Caren is quite timid and a loner. She doesn\u0027t like to be picked up and hisses at unfamiliar cats if they get too close. Caren lost an eye about two weeks before she arrived at her foster\u0027s home, so it\u0027s possible she\u0027s still acclimating to her world by sitting in one place all day and not moving around much. Sometimes Caren will let her foster put her in her lap. At other times she jumps free and heads back to the spot she was just in, usually that small, out-of-the-way space she feels safe in. While she does venture out to her food bowl (a girl\u0027s gotta eat) and litter box, it\u0027s only at night when her foster is asleep. Clearly she knows what to do and how to do it, but can\u0027t quite bring herself to engage fully with her surroundings. Of all the wonderful reasons there might be for you to adopt a cat as deserving as Caren, one of the most rewarding is the possibility of helping a confused and fearful animal emerge from her shell and begin to experience the daily delights of a safe, lively and loving home. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Coy - Cute - Bunny-like Sadie is the cutest little tri-pod you\u0027ll ever meet. Yes, you read that right: Sadie only has three legs, but she doesn\u0027t let that stand in her way, and neither should you! She has learned to navigate the world with the cutest little bunny hops! Sometimes she flops over on her back and puts her other three legs in the air while looking at you, daring you to tickle her fuzzy tummy. Sadie will meow softly when she wants attention, but for the most part she is a quiet kitty who enjoys long naps in the sunshine, but who is usually happy to play with you when approached. Her lack of a leg means that she needs to stay indoors, but other than that, she has no special requirements! We\u0027re not sure if Sadie is dog-friendly. A gentle, cat-savvy dog that will not knock her off balance might be fine, with proper introduction. Small children who might not understand that her balance is precarious are probably best avoided, but Sadie would be fine with older kids. She\u0027s picky about her feline companionship, and might enjoy being the only cat in the home, as she was bullied by the resident cats in her last home. Sadie is a sweet, gentle girl with a lot of life and love in her, and not an ounce of self-pity. Let this little cat-rabbit hop her way into your heart. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Dapper, Regal, Sweet Jack is a sweet old kitty who just wants a family to love. He\u0027s a very chill guy. He prefers hugs, pets and lap time to shenanigans. He sometimes stares at you with his toungue partially out and he sometimes falls asleep sitting up... it\u0027s SO CUTE! Jack was found outside. He\u0027s been declawed and he had to have his teeth removed. He still adores people, even children. He\u0027d do great with a gentle buddy who wants to snuggle instead of play. He\u0027s tolerant of other cats and will sleep by them or a share a window ledge with them. Jack is also FeLV+ (Feline Leukemia Virus), which causes a weakened immune system and requires special care. APA! provides some medical assistance after adoption. Cats with FeLV typically have a shortened lifespan. Sterling is not contagious to people or dogs, but should live only with other FeLV+ cats. For more information, please contact APA! or read more by our Partner, Best Friends Animal Society: http://bestfriends.org/Resources/FAQs-About-Feline-Leukemia-Virus-FeLV Jack wants to find himself a calm, big family to take care of him. He wants to lay in the window and snooze. That\u0027s the least we can do for this gentle, sweet guy who\u0027s stayed positive and loving through it all. Do you have the love and affection he needs?

    "description": "ndependent, Shy, Mellow Not everyone is pretty enough to strut down the runway, but true to her name, Sashay can! This gorgeous gal is a real beauty queen with her soft white coat and big hazel eyes; she\u0027s so well groomed, she\u0027s even done her eyebrows (the small gray smudges above her eyes). Sashay is a dignified kitty and while she enjoys playing, it\u0027s not with any riff-raff (aka other cats) around. If your living room was high school, she\u0027d play singles tennis or golf. She also enjoys lounging in a cozy spot, with or without her person nearby. When Sashay decides it\u0027s time for cuddles, she\u0027ll let out a little meow to get your attention. After that, she prefers chin and hindquarters scratches and sporadically enjoys a belly rub or two. Given Sashay\u0027s disinclination to be around other cats, she would most likely do poorly with children or dogs. Sashay would be happiest in a home where she can be the star of the show as the only pet, in a family of people who understand that sometimes stars need their space and beauty rest away from their adoring fans. Like any celebrity though, she can\u0027t resist the siren call of the limelight (namely, your lap) and will always come back for more. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Intriguing, Curious, Handsome Marty has a striking coat full of bold tabby spots and swirls scattered in random beauty over his snowy white fur. His personality is equally special...a mixture of curiosity, aloofness and acceptance of love on his own terms. No doubt, a quintessential cat! Marty was rescued by APA!, along with his brother, Hank, from a hoarding situation. The two are very attached to each other, and love cuddling and playing together with their favorite catnip mouse! Marty gains such confidence when he is with Hank and will allow you to pet him and pick him up only when they\u0027re together. He also becomes more playful and interested in people if Hank is by his side. Marty is definitely a people watcher...look up from your chores and you\u0027ll often find him coyly observing you with fascination. He\u0027s an explorer too and enjoys walking about and checking out his world. It would be best if Marty was not in a home with small children or with someone looking for the snuggly type. He\u0027s too cool for cuddles! We\u0027re not sure how Marty would do around dogs. We can say he didn\u0027t react to his foster\u0027s dogs that he saw through a fence. In addition to adoring his cherished brother, Marty gets along well with other cats. Marty would be the perfect fit for a cat savvy person and, ideally, sweet Hank could be adopted along with him. If you respect and appreciate the quirky characteristics that make cats so uniquely awesome and are ready to open up your heart to a kitty (or two) who may never have experienced the security and comfort of a loving home, contact us to meet Marty today! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Relaxed, Calm, Gentle Clampett might have the name of a rambunctious family, but he is one chill dude. This kitty has seen a thing or two and knows better than to get riled up over every little thing. There\u0027s no demanding of affection from him - he\u0027s content to wait patiently near you for head scratches and cheek rubs. Once you\u0027ve noticed him, he\u0027s more than happy to be picked up, placed in your lap, and receive any pets you\u0027re willing to give. Clampett isn\u0027t about to win any awards for most toy mousy attacks or feather wand demolition, as he would much rather just sit in a window and watch the world go by. Clampett\u0027s calm extends into his dealings with other felines. He wonders why we all can\u0027t just get along and stays out of conflicts in the sanctuary. He even seems to enjoy relaxing with the other cats. He hasn\u0027t been around dogs or children, but most likely would be fine with very calm dogs or older children; so long as they\u0027re gentle and understand that the most important thing is chilling out, everyone should get along fine. Clampett\u0027s perfect home would be one that can appreciate a relaxed cat with a mild disposition and give him the affection and window ledges that he deserves. Clampett is FeLV+ (Feline Leukemia Virus), which causes a weakened immune system and requires special care. APA! provides some medical assistance after adoption.

    "description": "Peaceful, Honest, Soft Ever have a friend who tells you the truth, no matter what? And yet, you never doubted her love for you? Well, that sounds like our Elvis (who is female, by the way)! Don\u0027t take it personal if Elvis swats at you; it means she is just nervous about something. She is actually very affectionate! She will reach up to you with her front paws, stretching them on your legs, and this means that she wants you to pick her up. She will let you hold her like a baby (if she is in the mood) and likes to sit in your lap. She may even touch your face with her soft paws to encourage you to pet her. Elvis is a bit temperamental, so if she gets spooked by something - or maybe doesn\u0027t like the way you are petting her - that is when she may swat. No biggie, just let her work it out on her own, and eventually she will come back to you, all lovey-dovey. Don\u0027t write her off, just give her time! Elvis has diabetes and requires some extra medical care, which may include a regulated diet and/or insulin. For more information, please contact APA! Elvis isn\u0027t interested in playing; her goal in life is to find a comfy lap and settle into it. She is a beautiful girl who should live with patient and cat-experienced people in a low-traffic home - and be the only cat. She would prefer for her human to be a working-from-home person or someone with a flexible schedule that allows them to spend a good chunk of time at home - she is social and likes to hang out with you! Contact us today to arrange a meet \u0026 greet with Elvis! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip.

    "description": "Mellow, sociable, wise Not long ago, Austin Pets Alive! took in eight (count \u0027em, eight) cats whose owner had just passed away. Seven of them have been adopted. We\u0027d like you to meet number eight. His name is Lily. Yes, \"His.\" And yes, \"Lily.\" Having lived with so many cats, Lily does just fine with newcomers of his species, but isn\u0027t all that interested in snuggling or playing. It\u0027s as if he\u0027s saying, \"Hello there, my name is Lily. Yes...yes...Lily. I get asked that a lot. What do you say we just sit for a while on this nice, soft carpet and take in all the interesting things that are going on in the house? Which reminds me, when\u0027s dinner?\" Of course, Lily has had plenty of experience with humans as well, so he\u0027s perfectly comfortable in their presence...although his preference seems to be sitting NEXT to them rather than ON them. Either way, he\u0027s very pleasant company. Lily\u0027s back is somewhat tender, and he has a bit of arthritis in his hips for which he takes supplements and pain meds. So if his new home does have any children, we\u0027d recommend the gentler the better. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information, or to meet Lily, please email [email protected]",

    "description": "Sweet, Relaxed, Quiet Coco loves to be loved and petted, and will rub her face on your hand when you pet her! She may meow to signal her delight, but otherwise she is a quiet girl. As much as she loves affection from you, she has no need to lie on you or be held; she is content to be next to you! Coco has oddly-shaped front feet (which is congenital, not due to any kind of trauma), so she walks a little slower and differently than other kitties. And while she may shuffle around the house, it doesn\u0027t keep her from zipping to her food dish when it\u0027s mealtime! When she came to APA! she was thin and needed extra nutrition, so she is on a prescription diet of dry and wet food so that she can gain weight and improve her overall health. She definitely likes it, because she eats well and is easy to feed! Coco may bat around a cat toy now and then, but she excels at napping, which is her favorite thing! She lets the dog in her foster home sniff her, but she doesn\u0027t seem to like other cats. We think her ideal home would be with adults, gentle and cat-respectful older children, and maybe an easy-going dog. Coco is a sweetie! Contact us today to arrange a meet \u0026 greet. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

She enjoys lounging right in the middle of the bed and will sit on your lap... on her own terms, of course. She\u0027ll also play with the occasional wand toys. Before her stay with APA!, Kitty had been declawed. As a result of this she must remain an indoor cat. Kitty could probably live with another cat, but she greatly prefers her space. She\u0027s also easily over-stimulated, so calm kids are best. Kitty is searching for a forever home where she can get the attention and admiration she deserves.

    "description": "Cuddly, Energetic, Sassy Minka is a beautiful and sweet kitty who is looking for her forever home! She loves to sit on your lap and make biscuits while she nuzzles you under your chin. Pet her on the head and she immediately starts to purr! She will tell you in her rather sassy fashion if she\u0027s not in the mood to be petted; nothing dramatic, however. Most of the time she\u0027s all in for petting! Minka is a nut for catnip toys and will bat string toys around. She is a big fan of long cat snoozes; she is affectionate and likes to be around people, but will seek out her own space for some alone time to recharge her batteries. Minka is tolerant of other kitties as long they respect her boundaries. She may get a bit grouchy if another cat wants to play when she isn\u0027t in the mood, so her ideal feline companion should be respectful and easy-going. Minka hasn\u0027t spent much time around children, but she would be a better companion for older, cat-savvy kids. Minka is not a chatty girl, but will respond if you talk to her! All the while gazing at you with her amazing yellow eyes. If she sounds like the kitty you have been searching for, contact us today to arrange a meet \u0026 greet! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Minka, please email [email protected]",

    "description": "Graceful, Calm, Beautiful Meet Yolie, a little slice of kitty heaven! She is a calm, poised cat who loves time to herself. She doesn\u0027t really like to be picked up, but she will curl up, settle down, and stay in one spot. (But we think that over time, she may decide that she wants to be a lap cat!) Yolie likes to play with quiet toys - no jingle balls, please! She is a fan of the Cat Dancer. She is a low-maintenance girl, the perfect cat for a low-activity home. She ignored the friendly cat she met, so it seems she is okay as an only cat. She would like a home with people who have time to spend with her, however; we think there is an inner outgoing kitty that would express itself, given the right environment! Yolie\u0027s brown fur with happy orange spots is a part of what makes her graceful and gorgeous! Contact us today to meet her. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Misunderstood, Quiet, Rough-around-the-edges The first thing you may notice about Donkey are his ears! Which are rather beat up from his previous life. But we think they make him distinctively handsome and a bit mysterious! Donkey would love a home with other cats! He will snuggle with them, groom them, and hang out with them. He is a mellow guy and would do best with a cat with a similar personality; no sassy cats, please. Donkey\u0027s human companions should be young adults or adults - loud noises and unpredictable activity startle and scare him (and he may give an indignant hiss to let you know what he thinks, but nothing more than that), so little, active kids would be too much for him. He needs things on the quiet, routine side! His cat-experienced humans also should be able to give him gentle socialization and the TLC he so richly deserves. Donkey likes to purr! And he likes for you to pet him. Contact us today to meet Donkey! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip.

    "description": "Goofy, Playful, Entertaining Macadamia is a fun-loving kitty who also enjoys a good nap! She likes to play with toys, especially batting at wand toys! She\u0027s a real character and will sometimes run from you as if she\u0027s shy. The truth is, she\u0027s just playing hard to get! Eventually, she\u0027ll come running to greet you at the door and roll over to show you her fluffy belly. She warms up quickly and loves to be petted gently. She isn\u0027t a lap cat but lets you pick her up. Like many kitties, her favorite activity of all is napping! Although Macadamia does get along with other cats - she is curious about them and wants to sniff them - she prefers to be the queen cat in the household and sometimes asserts her dominance with bops (especially if another cat gets too close to her food). Macadamia hasn\u0027t been in a home with children but would likely acclimate to older kids as long as she felt secure. We haven\u0027t seen her around dogs so we have no idea, but we suspect she would try to boss a dog around! Macadamia is quirky and endearing! She will charm you with her antics, win you over with her silly personality, and keep you entertained. Her ideal home would probably be with people who would play with her, adore her, understand her completely, cater to her every whim...you know how cats are. Contact us today to meet sweet Macadamia. She\u0027s a nut! Macadamia is FeLV+ (Feline Leukemia Virus), which causes a weakened immune system and requires special care. APA! provides some medical assistance after adoption. Cats with FeLV typically have a shortened lifespan. She is not contagious to people or dogs, but should live only with other FeLV+ cats. For more information, please contact APA! or read more by our Partner, Best Friends Animal Society: http://bestfriends.org/Resources/FAQs-About-Feline-Leukemia-Virus-FeLV All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip.

    "description": "Curious, Skittish, Alert It\u0027s almost too bad that Kat is so floofy-gorgeous, because that could make you overlook the cat within. But there\u0027s more to Kat than her good looks; she is a lady with a rather sassy, independent spirit! To be Kat\u0027s true-love human companion, you should be cat-experienced and have realistic expectations - and give her time to get used to you and her new home. Kat isn\u0027t a big cuddler, but when she is, her cuddling is so sweet! Be patient; she will love you in her own time. She can be unpredictable and skittish, but typically she is interested in meeting new people. She may nip if she is in a nippy mood, so she should be supervised around young children who might provoke her. Sometimes when Kat runs, she does a funny little jump-run where she bounces up and down - and it is especially cute because the markings on her fur make it look like she is wearing cool, kicky boots! With one glance you will see that she is eye-poppingly gorgeous with her fluffy, multi-colored coat, whiskers for days, and perfect markings around her eyes. Kat is more curious and active than she is playful; she would rather explore every inch of the house than play with a toy. You can engage her in play, but it usually doesn\u0027t last long. Her new home should have nooks and crannies for her to investigate, and maybe even a tall cat condo to climb and hang out in. She would be best as an only cat, and as for dogs - well, the ones she has met have been overly-active and scared her. Previous to her stay with APA!, Kat had been declawed. As a result of this she must remain an indoor cat. Kat is really nice! She just needs cat-experienced people who will give her a chance. Contact us today to arrange a meet \u0026 greet! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Chatty, Kitten-Sized, Independent Say hello to Stripes, a diminutive little lady who has lots to talk about! Although she is mostly independent and shy, Stripes will open up to if you sit and chat with her for a while. When she\u0027s tucked away, she will happily come out to play if you call her name enough. Stripes is your best chatty friend who is always excited to share her feelings with you. Stripes is extremely active for an older cat, especially in the evening/night. She really loves to pounce on strings and other toys that she can chase around. She lets you know she\u0027s happy while playing by shaking the tip of her tail like a fluffy rattlesnake, punctuated with loud purrs. She also loves cat tunnels for play, to relax in, or just as her go-to place where she knows she always can be comfortable. She also likes to watch the world go by from her window perch (aka: Cat TV). Stripes\u0027 tiny body and features makes her kitten-like in appearance. She\u0027s missing a couple teeth, but that makes her look even cuter! And who wouldn\u0027t love to gaze longingly into her giant eyes? Because Stripes is more active in the evening, she would do best in a home that can give her some attention after dinner time. She should be fine in a household with other cats if they are calm and respect her space. We have yet to see her around kids and dogs. Do you have a window, a few toys, and some love to spare?

    "description": "Silly, playful, friendly You\u0027ve most likely heard the term \"hail fellow, well met,\" possibly while studying the odd Shakespeare play, to describe a person who\u0027s enthusiastically hearty, friendly and congenial. With that in mind, we\u0027d like you to meet Alex, our very own \"hail feline, well met.\" Alex has yet to meet a human who not only takes to him immediately, but finds his warm, sweet personality impossible to resist. They also find his habit of begging for a treat 10 minutes after receiving a treat amusing, even endearing. Alex enjoys being petted, loves nothing more than watching TV with you on the couch and can\u0027t wait to fall asleep with you at night. He\u0027s not really a lap cat, but he\u0027s an excellent \"I want to be right beside this person for the foreseable future\" cat. When people aren\u0027t available, catnip and feather-on-a-srtring toys are an acceptable substitute. How Alex would fare with dogs or kids is an unknown, but he does enjoy play-wrestling with his foster\u0027s other cat. They\u0027re not what you\u0027d call affectionate with each other...just pals. His foster also feels that a small human companion or two would fit right in with Alex\u0027s welcoming, unagressive nature. At the same time, attention hog that he is, being an only pet in the house wouldn\u0027t exactly break his heart. Alex\u0027s caterwauling (yep, that\u0027s where that word comes from) won\u0027t bother you at all, because he doesn\u0027t do any. In fact, he only meows when he is hungry and, even better, when you are about to feed him. With so much to recommend him (and just a couple things he needs to work on) it\u0027s hard to imagine Alex not moving into a loving home with someone real soon. Anyone? Anyone? Alex is FeLV+ (Feline Leukemia Virus), which causes a weakened immune system and requires special care. APA! provides some medical assistance after adoption. Cats with FeLV+ typically have a shortened lifespan. Alex is not contagious to people or dogs, but should live only with other FeLV+ cats. For more information, please contact APA! or read more by our partner, Best Friends Animal Society: http://bestfriends.org/Resources/FAQs-About-Feline Leukemia-Virus-FeLV/ All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information, or to meet Alex, please email [email protected]",

    "description": "Free-Spirited - Affectionate - Loving Sunnie is truly a free spirit. She was rescued from a life on the streets, and still has her street smarts about her. She\u0027s very loving, and wants to be someone\u0027s lap cat. However, her time on the streets have made her a little wary, and her special humans will need to give her gentle encouragement to continue her transition to adored indoor lap-cat. She will reward you with lots of love and purrs! Sunnie loves to cuddle and play with the resident cat in her foster home, and would love to go to a home with another kitty for company. She is not, however, a fan of dogs, although she can tolerate them if they keep a respectful distance. Sunnie can be a tiny bit skittish, and for this reason, we don\u0027t recommend a home with small children, although older children would be fine. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Charming, Calm, Caring, Vinnie is a super chill cat and the perfect house-mate! Vinnie always looks like the coolest of cats in her sleek and chic black coat, with an adorable quirky dip to one ear. She has a beatnik vibe, and while particular about the company she keeps (she likes to have a getting-to-know-you period), Vinnie will be soon pouring on the affection. She does her best to always be touching you - rubbing up against you just to let you know she is there. When snuggle time is over, she puts the Cat in \"Cat-Nap\"! As a more mature girl, she has excellent manners, is peacefully quiet, and has impeccable litter box habits. And, grooming is a favored past time, as she goes absolutely goes gaga about being brushed! Vinnie has had the chance to meet another cat and seemed quite unruffled, but since being in foster care, she has not been around kids or dogs. She previously lived with an older adult in a quiet home. This sweet girl likes to relax most of the day, but loves greeting you with a rub whenever she is about the house. If you are looking for a calm and relaxing companion, Vinnie would be a fabulous addition to your family. She would be good with one human to call her own; it might take her a little longer to adjust to multiple people, but she bonds easily, so just give her a little time! Contact us today to meet this loving lady! Vinnie Is a healthy FIV+ (Feline Immunodeficiency Virus) cat. FIV+ cats typically live long, healthy lives! For more information, please contact APA! or read this FAQ: http://bestfriends.org/Resources/FAQs-About-Feline-Immunodeficiency-Virus-FIV All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip.

    "description": "Shy, Loving, Easy Mimi is a beautiful senior cat with mesmerizing eyes. As an older gal, she prefers to spend her days lounging around, making her ideal for an owner who works during the day. She doesn\u0027t really enjoy being picked up, however, once night rolls around, she loves to come find you to get pets and some good cuddles! You won\u0027t have to question when this affectionate girl needs petting, because she\u0027ll definitely let you know by grabbing your hand with her paw! She\u0027ll also chase cat toys and bat them around on her own now and then. But, overall she prefers napping to playing. Mimi is pretty quiet most of the time but likes chirping and purring to get attention rather than meowing. Although she is a little shy at first, it only takes her a couple of days to warm up. Once that happens, this easygoing, sweet girl absolutely loves to hop in your bed and snuggle with you at night! Her favorite thing to do is to put her little nose in front of your face while you\u0027re sleeping and purr to get your attention. She is skittish around kids and most likely would be the same with dogs. So, a home without either would be best. Mimi would do well in a tranquil household with one or more adults who will give her the time she needs to warm up and who enjoy soft, kitty snuggles. If this sounds like you, contact us to meet Mimi today! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Mimi, please email [email protected]",

She\u0027s definitely the baby of the group and follows the lead of her siblings. She\u0027s curious and likes to check out what the others are doing, but she\u0027s a little more independent and enjoys spending time by herself to recharge.

    "description": "Sweet, polite, small Libby came to us young, pregnant, and alone. She had her kittens in our nursery and did a fabulous job raising them. Now that she\u0027s in a foster home, she\u0027s learning how to enjoy all of the things we wish for every kitty - toys, soft napping spots, and lots of cuddles! She\u0027s still shy and likes to hides under the bed. So if you\u0027re afraid of under-the-bed monsters, she\u0027ll keep you safe from them! Once she starts to warm up to you, she wants you to pet and snuggle her. She doesn\u0027t yet show a strong interest in toys, but we do see hints of a mighty huntress in the making. She never gets into any trouble, and she\u0027s as quiet as a mouse. Given the proper introduction, Libby loves the company of other cats! She\u0027d actually benefit from a home with another like-minded kitty. She seems to be afraid of dogs. We haven\u0027t seen her with kids, but given how timid she is, she might also be afraid of them. Libby has a favorite spot in her foster home, her beloved cat tree! You can see her cuddled up in there in her photos. Since it makes her comfy, her fosters are offering to give it to her adopter. Libby has the sweetest face! Her eyes and coloring are gorgeous, and she\u0027s attentive and polite. She\u0027s very petite, like a kitten. She selflessly raised her little ones, and now we\u0027d love to see her have the chance be babied herself. Libby would be an excellent cat for a low-key family. She\u0027s well behaved and quiet, and she\u0027d do great in an apartment with a small family or with a human she can call her own, and a feline friend or two. In the right home, we know she\u0027ll be very happy and provide her family with many years of devoted companionship. You can follow Libby on Facebook!

    "description": "Purry - Playful - Determined Zig is an adorable tabby boy with the cutest speckled belly who got off to a rough start - he had an injured tail that required amputation. He\u0027s still recovering, but this determined fellow is thriving in his foster home. If you\u0027re looking for a cuddly cat, Zig\u0027s got you covered - this guy absolutely lives to snuggle. He loves being petted and prefers to be in your lap as often as possible. Fair warning: you may not get much done with this lovebug around. Zig will try to sleep on your pillow at night so as not to miss out on a prolonged opportunity to be near you. Clearly, Zig loves humans (adults and older kids) and cats and gets along well with the other foster kittens and resident adult felines in his foster home. He has not met any dogs yet, but a calm, cat-friendly canine would probably be okay. Zig is about average in terms of his energy level. He loves to play with strings, shoelaces, and balls. But he\u0027s lacking the crazy kitten energy, mainly because he\u0027d rather be cuddling up to you. This lap cat would do well in any loving home where humans are willing to be captive to his charms and snuggle often. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

He is afraid of humans at this point, and if you move your hand towards him to pet him, don\u0027t take it personal if he moves out of reach. He\u0027s just not sure about this trust thing yet. The way to Eclipse\u0027s heart is through playing! His playfulness overcomes his shyness (while he\u0027s playing) - just move a wand toy around or toss a ping pong ball for him, and he goes into action. He\u0027s still not sure about trusting you, but you get high marks in his eyes for playing with him. And speaking of his eyes - he has big, beautiful, golden eyes! Eclipse is comfortable around other cats; he will play and cuddle with his feline roommates! His new home should be with patient, cat-savvy people who will give him time to bloom on his own schedule - and probably a friendly cat to buddy up with.

It could be because he\u0027s the runt, or maybe it\u0027s his big bubble eyes and dainty ears, but there\u0027s something about Dip that makes him irresistible. Dip is famously known for romping around playing with his cat toy ball and acting tough when he wrestles his brothers. He\u0027ll wear himself out quickly, and then be ready for some snuggle time. This little guy will even roll over and enjoys being pet on his soft fluffy belly. Added to his already endearing cuteness, Dip has a squeaky purr and a habit of nibbling his own toes. Dip would be perfect for a home with other cats, dogs, and children. He\u0027ll win you over with his overwhelming charm! Contact us today to meet Dip!

He loves nothing more than to curl up in your lap and purr the day away while making biscuits. He\u0027s not whiny, but he sure is a chatty cat. If you talk to him, he\u0027ll talk right back. He\u0027s a little shy at first, but before you know it, Simon will be winning you over with his sweet quirks. He\u0027s more of a dog than a cat, really. He comes when he\u0027s called, follows you around the house, and even loves water! Simon\u0027s not very playful since he\u0027s a senior kittyzen, but he\u0027s been known to bat a wand toy around from time to time. Simon would thrive in a house with people who can give him plenty of love. He\u0027s pretty indifferent toward other cats; they\u0027re tolerable. He\u0027s not the biggest fan of dogs, but he\u0027s gotten used to his foster\u0027s pup. If they agree to keep their distance it should be fine. He\u0027s fine to hold down the fort while you\u0027re at work, but expect lots of affection when you get home. Simon will truly make your house a home. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Simon, please email [email protected]",

He has an outgoing spirit and is always ready to start a conversation. Fermi charms everyone he meets and will happily curl up in your lap if you let him. Fermi is a real social butterfly! He is particularly great with other cats. He will snuggle up and take sunny cat naps with his feline friends, and give affectionate headbutts and face rubs. The first thing you may notice about this handsome guy (other than his great pickup lines) are his eyes. We\u0027re not sure how, but Fermi only has one working eye!

If you stare at him long enough, you may even see your future - and he could be in it! Don\u0027t worry, Fermi\u0027s different eyes certainly don\u0027t slow him down.

    "description": "Beautiful - Sweet - Affectionate Look at that sweet little tortie face! Cassatt is the perfect kitten for a retired couple, or a single person with a fairly calm and quiet home looking for a little snuggle buddy. Initially shy, once she is comfortable with you, she is very sweet and affectionate. She loves to be pet and will march around making biscuits and she likes her tummy rubbed. Her favorite time of the day is when her foster comes home and goes to bed for the night - Cassatt loves to snuggle up right beside her and get pets and fall asleep! Whereas her sister bounces off the walls 24/7 with kitten energy, Cassatt is generally more on the mellow side. When Cassatt is EXTRA happy, she makes adorable little faces! This normally occurs when you scratch the bridge of her nose. She will open her mouth slightly and close her eyes in bliss! Sometimes when you stop too early, she will keep her mouth open and lean in and open her eyes SUPER wide as if to say \"Oh no! Why have you stopped petting me?\" Cassatt also has extra thick, luxurious fur. She has been in a foster home almost all of her life, so she\u0027s been well fed and cared for the entire time! This shows in her beautiful coat. We wouldn\u0027t quite call her medium haired, but it\u0027s very thick and bunny soft. She loves other cats! She would benefit from an outgoing cat friend. She\u0027s very sweet with all cats she meets. Cassatt is a little scared of dogs, but has done well with her foster\u0027s dog who totally ignores her. She\u0027d likely do just fine with a calm and gentle dog, or maybe a low energy senior. Cassatt\u0027s best life will be in a home with another cat for company, and mostly adult humans, or maybe some older kids, with the time and patience to give her space while she warms up. It will probably take a little bit of time, but she is very worth the effort! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Cassatt, please email [email protected]",

    "description": "Shy, Playful, and Soft Cezanne has the beginnings to be a beautiful, long-haired cat who is fluffy and soft like a cloud! She is fairly skittish, and takes time to adjust to her new surroundings. Once she adjusts, you can expect her to be chatty and affectionate. She is very sweet! She loves to be petted, and will even pet herself with your hands. When she is learning to trust people, she will meow to make sure it is okay to approach you and say hello. If you talk to her gently, she will come and say hi. She is playful and LOVES wand toys! She will play with them all day if you let her. One thing that Cezanne does that is extra cute is stand on her hind legs to bed for pets! If you aren\u0027t paying attention to her, she will stand on them and meow at you - she seems to know that this is a very cute trick, and that it is extremely effective. She LOVES other cats, and is great with them. She would love another cat in the home, especially if the other cat is confident and outgoing. She might be okay with a gentle and calm dog who would mostly ignore her. Her ideal home would be with gentle, cat-savvy people with patience to allow her to adjust to her surroundings. She would likely not be a good companion for a young child, but would likely do just fine with older, cat savvy kids. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Talkative - Sweet - Shy Like his namesake Nick Fury, this Nick only has one eye,which gives him a jaunty look but causes no pain. Shy for a bit until he gets to know you, once you\u0027re friends, you will discover that he\u0027s a chatty kitty who loves to carry on a conversation with you. He also LOVES his cat toys. If you will play with him with his toys, you will become his friend in short order. Nick Furry is also independent, though, and will happily play with his toys alone when you\u0027re too busy. This little fellow adores the company of other kitties and would be happiest in a home with at least one other cat to cuddle and play with. He\u0027ll melt your heart with his loving grooming and snuggles that he imparts to the other kitties. Nick Furry would do best in a home without dogs or small children as he is easily frightened. Nick\u0027s ideal home would be quiet and stable, with another FeLV+ kitty for company, and lots of toys and pets from his special human. He\u0027ll reward you with lots of love! Nick Furry is FeLV+ (Feline Leukemia Virus), which causes a weakened immune system and requires special care. APA! provides some medical assistance after adoption. Cats with FeLV typically have a shortened lifespan. Nick Furry is not contagious to people or dogs, but should live only with other FeLV+ cats. For more information, please contact APA! or read more by our Partner, Best Friends Animal Society: http://bestfriends.org/Resources/FAQs-About-Feline-Leukemia-Virus-FeLV All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Nick Furry please email [email protected]",

    "description": "Independent, Tiny, Quirky Although Rue is a fully-grown 1.5 year old kitty, she is so tiny that she still looks like a kitten! Her neck is so short that she reminds you of those egg-shaped Russian dolls. Her broken tail gives her an edgy, alley-cat vibe that is hilariously inconsistent with her otherwise adorable, lovable self. Her round little face is so cute that when she yawns, it will bring you to your knees. When you hold her like a baby, she\u0027ll look up at you with those huge eyes and you\u0027ll never want to put her down. This girl is the next cat-video star waiting to burst onto the scene! Rue still has that kittenish love of playing with anything and everything - toys, paper bags, her other foster cat buddy, whatever. When she plays, she plays full-out, but when the game is over, she\u0027s a total sunbather and couch potato. She is such a sweet, loving girl. She snuggles with her foster kitty buddy every night and licks him to sleep. If you\u0027re sitting or lying down anywhere, she\u0027ll be near you. She\u0027s not a lap cat and doesn\u0027t really enjoy being picked up and held, but she definitely loves to be petted and stroked. She\u0027s pretty quiet, and only meows when it\u0027s mealtime. Rue\u0027s ideal home would have another cat for her to play and cuddle. We haven\u0027t seen her with dogs or young kids, but think she might do best with no dogs and older, cat-savvy kids. If you are looking for an adorable, tiny, lovable perma-kitten, Rue might be perfect for you! Rue MeowClanahan is FeLV+ (Feline Leukemia Virus), which causes a weakened immune system and requires special care. APA! provides some medical assistance after adoption. Cats with FeLV typically have a shortened lifespan. Cora is not contagious to people or dogs, but should live only with other FeLV+ cats. For more information, please contact APA! or read more by our Partner, Best Friends Animal Society: http://bestfriends.org/Resources/FAQs-About-Feline-Leukemia-Virus-FeLV All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip.

    "description": "Laidback, Sweetheart, Friendly. Noodle is more laidback than playful, but she really digs other cats. She will groom them and cuddle with them. She might take a little coaxing to show you her friendly side. After a warm up she will be pushing her head into your hand for more scratches. Noodle has a wonderfully short tail that gives her a kitten sashay as she walks around the room. She is mostly quiet and cuddly. She might do well with a companion so she has someone to love on besides her human friends. She has not spent time around dogs or kids so that compatibility is still to be learned. If you want a calm cuddly friend, Noodle might just be your ticket. Contact us today to meet this laidback lady.

    "description": "Independent, Contemplative, Responsible Penelope is wise beyond her one year. She\u0027s already got a litter of kittens, and she is doing a great job as a mom! Because we met her with a fresh litter, she\u0027s been quite protective and not too sociable yet. But if she\u0027s in a mellow mood or you\u0027ve got a treat, you\u0027re golden! Penelope\u0027s foster said that she was a little hissy when they got near the kittens, but she never bit hard or used her claws, so she\u0027s just looking out for her babies and is definitely not mean-spirited. When she\u0027s not busy being an exemplary mother, Penelope enjoys relaxing on the couch and taking in all the fascinating sights. She can usually be found trotting around from window to window enjoying the views and basking in the sun. Her beautifully patterned black and white fur looks extra gorgeous in the sunlight, too! She can\u0027t stay with her kittens forever, though, and soon she\u0027ll be ready for her forever home! Penelope would do best with a patient person who can give her enough space to mellow out on her own terms. She\u0027s never been around dogs or other cats besides her kittens, but it would be a safe bet to have her in a home without other pets or kids. She also has a little limp in her back left leg, but it\u0027s nothing to worry about! If you\u0027re looking for a smart, independent kitty to sit with you as you sip your coffee and watch the world go by out the window, then Penelope is your purrfect match! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

Madison has socialized with cats, dogs, and kids so she would be perfect for just about any home! Her ideal home would have a family who can help her burn some kitten energy with lots of play time. Madison does have some CH balance difficulties. Feline cerebellar hypoplasia is a non-progressive, non-contagious neurological condition that causes balance issues. CH cats were born like this and usually wobble or have a funny gait; some cats have a minor imbalance and some are very wobbly! Cats with minor to moderate CH require no special care, or only minor accommodation, like avoiding stairs. Cats adopted from APA! with CH must be kept indoors only. CH cats have the same lifespan as other cats. For more information, please visit: lifewithchcats.com. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip.

They are always getting into mischief and public enemy number one is the toilet paper! After a full scale attack on the TP his brother will set off on another adventure but Pete retreats to the bathtub which is his favorite place to play. He is a little guy with big, curious eyes and a sweet personality. He is a little shy, especially around new people. He will let you hold him but he runs when you bend over to try and pick him up so you have to let him come to you. Pete would love to be in a home with a feline sibling to play with but doesn\u0027t seem like he would enjoy a canine friend or small children. He will need a home with patient humans who will let him get comfortable and find his way. Change throws him off a bit so he just needs to adjust and then he will be exploring his forever home....always with one eye out for the toilet paper!!

As with any kitten, he is curious which has been known to get him in a bit of trouble. He has started a full scale war with the toilet paper and is currently winning the battle! He rallies the troops and heads off into battle leaving a wake of shredded TP behind. Somewhat frustrating for his humans but still pretty cute! Once the battle has ended he will sit with you and let you hold and snuggle him and he lets you know when that time has come! He is a bit of a diva when it comes to getting attention!

    "description": "Peaceful, Sweet, Easy-Going Patsy is a refined lady with a pretty blend of dark and light in her torbie coat and a beautiful spirit that is sweet, gentle and full of love. This laid back senior is big on affection and is always up for a pleasing chin scratch or a nice belly rub. She enjoys the company of people and likes to hang out wherever you are, basking in the unspoken bond that you share. While her kitten days may be behind her, Patsy still has a playful side. Move your hand under a blanket, put out \"attacking\" paper or wave a teasing feather and it\u0027s time for kitty fun and games! Then it\u0027s back to calm lounging near her humans, Patsy\u0027s favorite activity. She\u0027s more than happy to bring out the welcome wagon when you return home by enthusiastically greeting you at the door...makes you feel good every time! Patsy is such a mellow lady, she would likely do fine with other cats and dogs as long as they live and let live. We haven\u0027t seen her around kids. But, given this relaxed lady\u0027s cool confidence and her love of belly rubs, she\u0027d likely be fine with them. Patsy is somewhat underweight and eats a special diet due to tummy issues. She\u0027ll meow at you now and then, especially around mealtime...maybe thanking you for the fancy meal you\u0027re about to give her or asking you to hurry it up, the true meaning is open for interpretation! Regardless of the exact message, Patsy\u0027s chats are always endearing. If you\u0027re interested in sharing your world and your heart with an easy, people-loving kitty, Patsy is a sure bet! Contact us to meet her today! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Relaxed, Easy-Going, Quiet In the hustle and bustle of life, sometimes you just want a mellow, uncomplicated, no-drama friend to hang out with. Wallace is that feline friend! He will cheerfully welcome your cuddling at any time, but won\u0027t follow you around to demand attention. He is content to lounge around and wait for an opening in your cuddling schedule! Wallace extends his good-natured behavior to other animals, both cats and dogs. He wants to be friends with other cats, but if he meets an unfriendly cat, he will retreat submissively and walk away in a relaxed, \"no worries!\" kind of way. Similarly, he wants to be friends with the dogs he has met, though he does prefer his canines on the quiet side; overly-active dogs that run towards him startle him. Otherwise, he easily shares space with dogs and has no problem approaching them when they are sitting or resting. What a great guy! Wallace is being treated for an non-contagious infection on his nose. He is a senior guy with a limp, though sometimes he will surprise you when he sprints and skips through the house! (No reason, just a burst of joyfulness he wanted to express.) He is friendly with kids, but since he is older, he\u0027s not the right playmate for children. He is supremely blissful when they pet him and treat him gently, though! Wallace likes to sit by a window and watch birds. He isn\u0027t interested in toys or climbing anything, but in his foster home there is a small, enclosed yard where he is allowed to go (always supervised!) - and he is excited to try and catch a bug. But that is short-lived, and then he is doing what he does best: napping and exuding complete satisfaction and fulfillment. Life is good! You might hear Wallace when it is time to eat and he discovers that his dish is empty, but that\u0027s about it. He is a low-maintenance cat that needs a quiet, low-traffic home. He enjoys peace, harmony, and a hushed environment! Having other animals with a similar personality to hang out with would suit him, too. Wallace takes \"content\" to a whole new level. Contact us today to meet this sweet boy! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "A Cloud Incarnate, Sweet, Calm Kip might have a short name but he\u0027s long on fluff! This cutie very well might just be made of a cloud and enjoys receiving any pets you have to give... In the name of collecting data, of course. He\u0027s not much of a lap cat, but loves to receive affection in any other form. Kip knows he\u0027s beautiful and can be a bit sassy, so he\u0027d be best suited to a house with older, cat-savvy children. A ferocious toy-mousy killer or a feather wand annihilator he is not - Kip\u0027s a cat that\u0027s perfectly happy to just hang out and watch the world go by. Kip isn\u0027t much of a fan of other cats - he\u0027ll tolerate another cat being near him, but will holler if he thinks they\u0027re invading his space. Said hollering is the only time this quiet boy feels the need to pipe up, so you know he means it! If his forever home contained another cat, you could expect a \"Craigslist roommates\" type situation - they live together peacefully, they use the same bathroom, but they\u0027re not really friends. Kip\u0027s perfect home would be one with a couple people to give him love and affection and just chill out. If you\u0027re looking for a fluffy buddy cat to keep you company, Kip just might be your man! Kip is FeLV+ (Feline Leukemia Virus), which causes a weakened immune system and requires special care. APA! provides some medical assistance after adoption. Cats with FeLV typically have a shortened lifespan. Kip is not contagious to people or dogs, but should live only with other FeLV+ cats. For more information, please contact APA! or read more by our Partner, Best Friends Animal Society: http://bestfriends.org/Resources/FAQs-About-Feline-Leukemia-Virus-FeLV All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Kip, please email [email protected]",

    "description": "Toblerone is a feisty, loving, and very fun kitten to have around! She can never get enough play time, will recharge her kitty batteries in a sunlit window, and then will engage in good bout of wrestling with her smaller sister, Fondue. When Toblerone settles in for a rest, she makes the ultimate napping partner - for any cat or human. She isn\u0027t a lap cat, but she is friendly and affectionate with everyone she has met, and appreciates a good cuddle! Toblerone dotes on her sister, Fondue. They snuggle sweetly together (while Toblerone grooms Fondue), tumble energetically around the house, explore everything, and playfully compete for every new toy. They keep each other company and make perfect play and cuddle buddies! Check out Fondue here - https://www.austinpetsalive.org/adopt/available-cat-details/?ID\u003d49197 Toblerone is quite the performer! From initiating a game of string chase to bouncing and bunny-hopping around on the bed, she makes sure to stay active. She wants to be near the action at all times! Toblerone has tested positive for Feline Leukemia (FeLV). It is possible for kittens six months and younger to shed this virus completely and test negative, so she will be re-tested for FeLV at her six month birthday, at which time a definitive diagnosis can be assured. Until then, she should live with no other cats or kittens to ensure the virus is not passed. Toblerone is available for adoption now to adopters who can accommodate a feline leukemia positive, or negative, cat as she is not yet of age to have a definitive test. For more information, please contact APA! or read more by our Partner, Best Friends Animal Society: http://bestfriends.org/Resources/FAQs-About-Feline-Leukemia-Virus-FeLV Toblerone is a looker - she\u0027s got it all! Contact us today to arrange a meet \u0026 greet. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Playful, cuddly, sweet Just when you think you\u0027ve seen all the literary cat-pun names that could possibly exist, another one shows up. In this case, the name is F. Scott Fitzferal, a soft, fluffy, brown tabby. F. Scott, as we\u0027ll call him for brevity\u0027s sake, would qualify as a socialite, if by that you mean that he can get along with pretty much anybody. Perhaps not right away-as with his foster\u0027s own cat, an alpha type. But a with slow introduction and a controlled environment they soon became fast friends. And while F. Scott hasn\u0027t been seen actually playing with the family dog, they have not fought with each other either. F. Scott is very fond of batting his toy monkey from here to kingdom come, as well as pouncing on strings dangled his way. He will also happily snuggle and cuddle with any nearby human. But by far his favorite fellow creature is his foster brother, whose name is...wait for it...J.R.R. Tolkitten, with whom he will cavort until the neighborhood cows come home. F. Scott Fitzferal should do quite well with a mellow dog or cat as well as with children 10 years and older (baby and toddler tolerance has not been tested). And the ideal home would be one that includes his best friend, play buddy and foster brother, J.R.R. Tolkitten. Two delightful puns for the price of one. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information, or to meet F.

    "description": "Loving, playful, curious When it comes to literary, play-on-words cat names, it\u0027s kinda hard to beat J.R.R. Tolkitten. (We\u0027ll pause here to allow your eyes to stop rolling.) Somewhat shy at first, J.R.R. can be excited to a fever pitch by those dangly string toys. Lord of the Strings, that\u0027s him. Small ball rattles will also keep him heavily occupied for...well...until a living, breathing kitten stops by, especially his favorite foster brother. His name is...wait for it...F. Scott Fitzferal. While J.R.R. (for short) is quite happy being around people, picking him up will not necessarily result in a cuddle session with the picker-upper. On the other hand, when he\u0027s managed to tire himself out and is feeling a bit sleepy, your lap will become a most welcome respite. Peals of purring will ensue, until it\u0027s time to wake up and discover all the interesting things in the next room. His foster\u0027s house cat is quite mellow around J.R.R. and both are willing to play if it suits them. And while he and the family dog are not yet play buddies, they seem to be on good terms. His foster\u0027s 11-year old sister absolutely adores him and the feeling seems mutual. He has not yet been exposed to the charms of babies and toddlers. Because J.R.R. takes a while to overcome his initial shyness, being adopted with his foster brother would be ideal to help with his socialization. Just picture it: two fluffy, tiny-pawed punsters, taking on the world together. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip.

    "description": "Friendly, Playful, Quiet Looking for a kitten who is a super snuggler, an enthusiastic player and all around fun? Let us introduce you to Fig! As soon as you walk in the room he wants to play or have a relaxing petting session. He doesn\u0027t mind being held and will snuggle up in your lap for a cozy nap. He goes full force at playtime, especially if you have strings or a kitty wand and, on occasion, he\u0027ll scamper after a jingly, jangly ball! He may get a little feisty when playing with you and give your finger a nip. But, if you say \"Ouch!\" he will lovingly lick the place where he bit you...such a sweetie! Fig has not met any kids. But, given his friendly, playful personality he\u0027d likely be fine with children. He hasn\u0027t interacted with dogs. He gets along nicely with his sister, Honey. So, he\u0027d probably become buddies with kitties who are easy going and sweet like him. Fig is not particularly vocal. He may meow when he\u0027s hungry, but mostly he\u0027s quiet. He\u0027s a smart little fella and already knows his name! He will almost always come running if you call out to him. Fig has tested positive for Feline Leukemia (FeLV). It is possible for kittens six months and younger to shed this virus completely and test negative, so Fig will be re-tested for FeLV at his six month birthday, at which time a definitive diagnosis can be assured. Until then, Fig should live with no other cats or kittens to ensure the virus is not passed. Fig is available for adoption now to adopters who can accommodate a feline leukemia positive, or negative, cat as HE/SHE is not yet of age to have a definitive test. For more information, please contact APA! or read more by our Partner, Best Friends Animal Society: http://bestfriends.org/Resources/FAQs-About-Feline-Leukemia-Virus-FeLV Fig would be happy as can be in a home with plenty of people to play with him and lots of room to run around and explore. He would love to meet you and demonstrate his cuddling skills, intelligence and mastery of all things kitten! Contact us to meet this cutie today! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Quiet, Curious, Cuddly Honey is an explorer who knows no bounds! Your shoulder is her mountain top and she\u0027ll climb up to it to take in the glorious views out the window. She may decide all that exertion calls for a nap and proceed to fall asleep right then and there. At other times she\u0027ll make the descent back down to your lap, another place she loves to catch some zzzs! Her curiosity is insatiable and takes her to exotic places such as cabinets, closets, bookshelves and table tops. She\u0027s stealthy, no doubt, sometimes becoming \"lost\" to her foster family when she quietly hunkers down in one of her newly discovered locales. Honey prefers that you don\u0027t hold her, a girl has to be ready for action if the next escapade calls after all! But, cuddles and pets are certainly welcome. She can be shy at first, but that doesn\u0027t last for long. Honey hasn\u0027t had any interactions with kids or dogs. But, she enjoys spending time with her sweet brother, Fig, who often joins her for adventures inside mysterious cardboard boxes or endlessly fascinating bathtubs. You may also find them wrangling with strings, wand toys and on occasion, those alluring and sometimes alarming jingly balls! Honey has tested positive for Feline Leukemia (FeLV). It is possible for kittens six months and younger to shed this virus completely and test negative, so Honey will be re-tested for FeLV at his six month birthday, at which time a definitive diagnosis can be assured.

    "description": "Resilient, Lover-Boy, Smart To say that Daddy-O is internationally famous would not be overstating it! He started his life in Mexico, where he was loved and cared for; so much so that because he tested positive for the Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV), his previous caretakers literally flew him to APA!, where we have a thriving FeLV sanctuary and robust adoption process for \"Felvie\" cats. Unselfishly, they wanted the best life for Daddy-O! And then an interesting thing happened: When Daddy-O arrived in Austin, he tested negative for FeLV! (This is not rare, but not as common as we would like it to be, of course.) So now Daddy-O is considered \"FeLV regressively positive\", basically meaning that he will test FeLV negative on most tests, can live with other FeLV negative cats, and likely has a totally normal lifespan ahead of him! All of this will be confirmed on a final re-test in August; until then, he must be kept separate from other cats. So, moving to another country can take a period of adjustment! Daddy-O is still getting used to everything. He is very sweet and adores being petted; his fanbase in Mexico says that he is a total biscuit-making lap cat when he is comfortable with his people and surroundings. We suspect any day now he will achieve total comfort and be over-the-top affectionate! Since Daddy-O is still getting used to his surroundings here, sometimes he is not comfortable around other cats; he can get a little jealous if you are loving on another cat when he thinks HE should be the focus your attention! He would probably prefer to be the only cat in his new home, or maybe with another easy-going cat. He interacts well with kids, though! Daddy-O may or may not play; we haven\u0027t seen an indication of him being interested in toys or playing. Daddy-O is a lovely, sweetheart of a cat, beloved in multiple countries! Contact us today to learn more about him and arrange a meet \u0026 greet. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Daddy-O, please email [email protected]",

Curious and energetic, the Colonel loves to play pretty much all day with his sisters: one eight-year-old human and one feline. Whether he\u0027s chasing and jumping on his sister, batting around furry mice, or leaping into cardboard boxes, Colonel Snazzypants gives it 110%. After he\u0027s worn himself out playing, he will fall asleep in an available lap and take a breather. He alos loves to curl up and snuggle with his littermate. While he\u0027s definitely full of kitten vim and vigor, the Colonel also loves to be cuddled and held by his human foster sister. He seems to love children and never runs away from her, so he would definitely do well in a permanent home with kids, particularly if they can keep up with his energy level. It\u0027s difficult to imagine not falling in love with such a sweet and sassy kitten! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip.

    "description": "Sweet, Shy, Loving Dear Cooper recently had the surprise of her life - up out of the blue, at the age of five, she was dropped off at the shelter by her family. Anyone would be nervous after such a shock, and Cooper is no exception. She loves to receive pets, but for right now, it\u0027s on her terms. She\u0027s quite the baker and adores making biscuits (kneading) - even though she\u0027s a little on edge now, it\u0027s obvious she\u0027s looking for a place to feel safe and practice her craft. Cooper even gives tiny little kisses to those she trusts! She also adores a good wand toy, especially one with feathers. Cooper\u0027s a mature lady though, and appears to be fonder of watching quietly than playing (but that might just be nerves). Cute Cooper is one adorable kitty with her orange blotches and creamy white coat. She even has an adorable little orange mustache! She is interested in other cats, but is a little too afraid right now to play with them. She hasn\u0027t met any dogs or children at this point. Her perfect home would be one that\u0027s calm and can provide her with her own space, like a covered cat house or crate. Cooper\u0027s just looking for a place to feel safe! Mustachioed Cooper is looking for her new best friend - could that be you? All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Cooper, please email [email protected]",

    "description": "Yakko and his sister, Dot, are blind kittens available to be adopted together! They were born with genetically malformed eyes, so enucleation (surgical removal of the eyes) was required. Now they are healing, doing great, and ready to find the perfect home. Yakko will curl up on your lap when he is sleepy - he is a snuggly guy who loves to be petted. He may also try to climb your leg, so you might want to provide a cat tree for him! He will boldly try to steal Dot\u0027s food, too - or wrestle her for it! Blindness has not curbed his curiosity or kitten behavior, and he has a great time running around the house. Yakko and Dot are bonded and help each other out, so they should be adopted together; Yakko will cry for her if she is in another room. Blind cats learn to use their hearing and memory to navigate life - and your house. Of course Yakko will always remain an indoor cat, and when you move furniture around, just introduce him to the new layout, give him a little while, and he will memorize the new floor plan. He is remarkable in his ability to adjust, and he will astound and inspire you! Yakko is soft, sweet, and handsome!

She loves toys and has no problem chasing things around the floor - she will even jump into the air if she hears something that she thinks needs to be jumped at! She is rambunctious; blindness has not curbed her curiosity, and she is usually ready for action. She will play with your feet, too (they make an interesting noise when you walk, after all!).

He and his siblings had a rough start before they came to Austin Pets Alive!, and little Neon was really underweight. They\u0027re all doing amazing now, and it\u0027s clear that Neon is feeling much better because his cute and silly personality has really started to shine. Neon is adventurous and escapes from the kitten room every chance he gets. But he doesn\u0027t get into trouble-he\u0027s just super curious, including about the adult cats in his foster home! He\u0027s also incredibly affectionate and snuggly and demonstrates his appreciation by purring wildly. He\u0027s a definite lap cat and loves snuggling with his siblings, too. He\u0027s not shy about gently tapping you or grabbing your hand if you stop petting him before he\u0027s ready. Neon would love to go home with one of his siblings-he and his brother Helium are frequent snuggle buddies. For more pictures and videos of Neon and his siblings, have a look at his foster family\u0027s Facebook page - https://www.facebook.com/AllTheKittiesFosters or Instagram account - https://www.instagram.com/allthekittiesfosters All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip.

She loves pets so much that if you stop, she\u0027ll gently grab your hand-sometimes with two paws!-to remind you to keep going. She also loves to snuggle up as close as possible and will lie down flat on your lap or chest for maximum contact. Like her siblings, Argon has mastered the purr. Argon has some permanent scarring on her left eye from her rough start before she came to Austin Pets Alive!, but it doesn\u0027t affect her in the least. She\u0027s a happy and loving kitten and is ready to share her love with an adopter or adopters! Argon would love to go home with one of her siblings. She gets along great with all of them but frequently snuggles with her sister Radon!

During the day she\u0027s sprightly, playing with toys and climbing all over her kitten condo. Vetra is fabulous with dogs and kiddos, so she would do well in a home with a cat-friendly canine. She hasn\u0027t spent time with other cats yet, but we imagine she would warm up to them quickly. Vetra has tested positive for Feline Leukemia (FeLV). It is possible for kittens six months and younger to shed this virus completely and test negative, so Vetra will be re-tested for FeLV at her six month birthday, at which time a definitive diagnosis can be assured. Until then, Vetra should live with no other cats or kittens to ensure the virus is not passed. Vetra is available for adoption now to adopters who can accommodate a feline leukemia positive, or negative, cat as she is not yet of age to have a definitive test. For more information, please contact APA! or read more by our Partner, Best Friends Animal Society:http://bestfriends.org/Resources/FAQs-About-Feline-Leukemia-Virus-FeLV All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip.

    "description": "Jaal is a sociable cat who thinks he\u0027s a dog! He has been introduced to dogs and he LOVES them. This little guy is super smart and confident, if he had thumbs and wasn\u0027t too busy playing, Jaal would take over the world... In addition to having a one of a kind personality, Jaal has some unique markings on his fur and his tiny paws look like he\u0027s wearing mis-matched socks. Do you have a dog at home that needs a day-time companion? Look no further than Jaal! This little guy is sure to bring some fun and excitement to your home! Jaal has tested positive for Feline Leukemia (FeLV). It is possible for kittens six months and younger to shed this virus completely and test negative, so he will be re-tested for FeLV at his six month birthday, at which time a definitive diagnosis can be assured. Until then, Jaal should live with no other cats or kittens to ensure the virus is not passed. He is available for adoption now to adopters who can accommodate a feline leukemia positive, or negative, cat as he is not yet of age to have a definitive test. For more information, please contact APA! or read more by our Partner, Best Friends Animal Society: http://bestfriends.org/Resources/FAQs-About-Feline-Leukemia-Virus-FeLV All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Jaal, please email [email protected]",

Our \"Sly\" is magical, too! He will charm you with his cute kitten antics, playing with the jingle ball and chasing his siblings around. So far, there is no way to break the spell he will cast over you, so you might as well accept it and enjoy it (which is easy to do, he\u0027s so adorable). Sly has a lopsided goatee that gives him a rather wicked look, but his big, baby eyes tip the scale into utter sweetness.

He is working on his Cloak of Invisibility, so you better stay on your toes - he may sprint through the door the moment you open it.

They play very well together, both dishing it out and taking it with good cheer. Zenith loves to run around and play chase, too! Zenith is interested in and curious about everything, and will be the first to check out a new toy - or anything new. He is just as likely to spend time cuddling with you, popping by for some quick affection, and then running off for more exploring. He\u0027s a well-rounded little guy! Zenith is good with the 7-year-old child in his foster home, too! He has beautiful markings; like looking at clouds and seeing shapes, you can gaze at his unique markings and see what shapes you see! He is going to grow into a gorgeous adult cat, for sure! Contact us today to arrange a meet \u0026 greet!

    "description": "Zelda had a rough start in life and didn\u0027t receive much socialization in her early weeks. She\u0027s getting more social every day, but is still cautious around people. She might not seek you out for attention, but if you initiate cuddling, she will relax and stay a while (especially if you have treats!). Zelda plays and gets along with the other cats and kittens, particularly her foster sibling, Aggie - she loves her! Zelda needs to live in a quiet house with a cat-savvy, patient owner who will work with her social skills to bring her out of her shell. Her home should probably be child-free and dog-free. But a friendly, respectful, and confident feline companion like Aggie would help her out a lot! It might look like Zelda has a resting mad face, but it\u0027s really just her unique mask-like markings! She is a pretty tabby. She\u0027s the biggest of her litter, and we think she will grow into a lovely adult cat. If Zelda sounds like the perfect fit for your home, your life, and your heart, contact us today to meet her! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

She exudes it and she brings it This soft as silk beauty approaches each day with joy and you\u0027ll feel it tickling your heart whenever she\u0027s with you. Joyce has just the right balance of activity and calm. Get out a toy and it\u0027s time to play. Lay down by her side and she\u0027s your serene friend, ready and happy for you to pet her pretty coat. Cheery chirps and coos are her specialty and playtime is filled with exuberance and fun. Wave the Cat Dancer around and this huntress will passionately jump for it or enthusiastically chase her twirling quarry down! She may even do her signature cat dance...standing on two legs while swatting at her feisty prey! Joyce is glad to take down toy mice too and when it comes to scratching, she\u0027ll gladly use her cardboard scratching pad with glee. Then there\u0027s Joyce\u0027s mellow side, so sweet and comforting. She enjoys quietly sitting by you and will come if you call her and give an encouraging pat to the floor or a blanket. She\u0027s not quite ready for laps, but she\u0027s definitely on the brink of being an absolute lap cat! Joyce is a very doting mother to her three precious kittens and would love if one of them could go along with her to her forever home. A mother\u0027s love is forever and always after all. Joyce is a healthy FIV+ (Feline Immunodeficiency Virus) cat. FIV+ cats typically live long, healthy lives! For more information, please contact APA! or read this FAQ: http://bestfriends.org/Resources/FAQs-About-Feline-Immunodeficiency-Virus-FIV Joyce is a well-trained, lovely cat who is ready to fill her days with carefree play and peaceful lovefests with her humans.

    "description": "Sweet, pretty, loving Introducing Veggie!! She is a sweet and loving girl looking to be somebody\u0027s favorite (and only) cat! She loves places that are calm and quiet and doesn\u0027t care much care for loud, except when it\u0027s her! She will let you know when she wants attention and prefers it in the form of chin scratches. Veggie is a beautiful calico cat with great striped markings and a vast assortment of coloring on her soft coat. She has a sweet face with big, soulful eyes that are hard to resist when she looks up and give you the sign she wants some love! She is a pretty laid back girl who does have a playful side and her favorite toy is any sort of wand. She will chase and jump in pursuit and has been known to get a little over excited and nippy when playing. That is a rare occurrence and even in the heat of a playful moment, her nip is gentle. One thing Veggie has made quite clear - she does not like other cats! She will let everyone know it with a little hissing and will give ant cat who gets close enough a little swat of the paw. While we have not seen her interact with any dogs all bets are she would feel the same about them. Veggie would do best in a home where she can be QUEEN of the castle and the solo pet. She would probably do well with older children but would likely not be a fan of little ones. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Veggie, please email [email protected]",

    "description": "Sweet, affectionate, playful We\u0027d like you to meet LouLou (yes, she prefers the French spelling). After being rescued from a feral colony, she soon discovered there\u0027s really something to be said for living with humans, even in a household populated by other cats plus two 100-pound dogs-as long as the pooches don\u0027t get too friendly and playful-like. After all, those humans know right away what this long-haired, black-coated temptress likes best, namely being held on her back like a baby and having her belly rubbed. (She doesn\u0027t take it as far as actual snuggling or cuddling of course, but, well, it\u0027s a start.) And in a house of her own, LouLou can finally focus on being a cat, running around and playing to her heart\u0027s content with those dangly wand toys or tiny stuffed mice she loves to bat and pounce upon. A fast learner, LouLou quickly figured out what to do with her scratching post and litterbox, and how to speak right up when she craves a bit of attention or some of that nice soft food she craves. If at all possible, LouLou would love to be adopted with another kitten of the same age. She\u0027d love to have someone to stalk around the house with like a mini-black panther on the prowl: for fun, adventure and a nice, warm spot to curl up and thank their lucky stars they ended up where they did. With a loving family. Like yours? All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information, or to meet LouLou (and maybe her brother Truffle), please email [email protected]",

    "description": "Beautiful - Shy - Energetic As evidenced by her portrait, Praline is a gorgeous white/torbie kitten with beautiful, anime-like golden eyes and a perfect, white-tipped tail. There\u0027s way more to Praline than her good looks, though. Formerly feral, Praline was found on the street and raised by a Good Samaritan until she was three months old, at which time she came to APA! She has been living in a pet-filled foster home, where she has developed perfect litter and scratching manners. She\u0027s also quiet as a mouse. Praline gets along very well with other cats, both her own littermates and the resident felines. She loves to play and has a ton of energy, whether she\u0027s pouncing on another kitten or batting around her toys. Praline will run around until she\u0027s exhausted and ready for a nap. There are two large resident dogs in Praline\u0027s foster home and she will tolerate them, but will run away if either move toward her, so she would prefer a dog-free forever home. She has not met any children, but since she prefers a calm, quiet environment, younger kids would probably not be a great fit. Praline can be shy and will sometimes run when approached, but she does enjoy being petted and scratched (especially under the chin). If you sneak up behind her and start petting, she is perfectly happy to stay in one place and receive affection. Praline also sleeps in her foster mom\u0027s bed at night, so it\u0027s likely that, in a quieter home with fewer animals, she will continue to come out of her shell. We think the ideal living situation for Praline would be a calm, relaxed household with one other friendly cat and loving and patient humans who want to help her blossom. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Sweet, Cuddly, Affectionate, Playful What a transformation! Hazel came to us as a sick, underweight, scared little 9-week-old stray. Under the loving care of her foster family, she has blossomed into a healthy, playful, love bunny! She is still initially cautious of new situations and of people she doesn\u0027t know, but once she feels comfortable, she loves, loves, loves to be petted! In fact, she\u0027d rather cuddle and be petted than play! Even when she\u0027s taking her time to hop up on your lap, you can see that she really wants to. And once you\u0027re petting her, she purrs up a storm to let you know how much she loves it. Hazel adores other cats. As soon as she sees one, she runs up to greet them and make friends. She has a girl crush on her foster\u0027s resident female cat. She hasn\u0027t yet met any dogs, so we don\u0027t know what she thinks of them. She hasn\u0027t yet met any kids, either. Given her initial shyness, she\u0027d probably be afraid of young fast-moving kids but fine with older, respectful ones. Hazel enjoys playing with kitty toys and her littermates, though she\u0027s not as hyper about it as most kittens are. Her favorite toy is the Cat Dancer, and she also likes to pounce on and grab fur mice and feather \"fishing toys. Hazel would do best in a quieter, low-key home with a cat-friendly cat or kitten, and with people who will give her the time and patience she needs to feel comfortable. She will reward your patience many times over with her sweetness and affection! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Hazel, please email us at [email protected]",

    "description": "Playful, Friendly, Relaxed Madam Curie is a gorgeous tortie with amazingly soft fur. Her face has different colors going right down the middle. She has a small body but big, fat paws! She is only one year old, so she has a lot of kitten qualities, but also adult maturity. She enjoys playing, and would do well in a house where someone can play with her, but she doesn\u0027t need to play all of the time. She will chase a wand or laser pointer for a few minutes but then relaxes. She loves to be petted, and does not mind being held or carried. Madam Curie chirps to say hello when someone enters the room, and to let you know that she\u0027s hungry - but overall, she\u0027s a quiet girl. She likes to lie near people and roll around them, but not ON them. (Maybe because of the heat!? We suspect she may be cuddlier in the winter!) She also enjoys sprawling out on the floor and sleeping, and when someone enters the room, she\u0027ll chirp and allow them to pet her. Madam Curie is very trusting, friendly, and comfortable in her foster home. She gets along well with the resident pets; she is not fazed by the adult cats, even though both of them have hissed at her! She remained calm, and then gently approached one of them for a nose sniff - she didn\u0027t even show any stress (or get \"poofy\") when one of them was near her kittens! In addition, Madam Curie gets along well with the resident chihuahua. She will raise her tail when he approaches, but will lie quietly while he sniffs her all over. If she isn\u0027t in the mood to play, she just walks away - no drama! And she has been known to playfully swat at him. Madam Curie is the sweetest, friendliest kitty. Her chirps are the best! She behaves in a chilled-out way with dogs, strange cats, people, and kids. She would be an amazing addition to your home! Contact us today to meet her. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Playful, Feisty, Lovable Jones is an average sized male cat, but he is truly larger than life! This striped furball knows what he wants, when he wants it, and he\u0027ll make sure you know too! He\u0027ll meow to let you know whenever he\u0027s not having a good time or not getting his way, like when it\u0027s time to get in his carrier or get in the car. Jones isn\u0027t all talk and no action, though. When he decides it\u0027s time for some lovin\u0027, he\u0027ll jump on top of you and demand attention. His go-to move to coerce you with cuteness is to flop over, show you his belly, and tuck his head under his front leg. It\u0027s super adorable! If that doesn\u0027t work, he\u0027ll even go so far as to rub his face on yours to make sure he receives some pets! He\u0027s also been known to jump on top of people\u0027s chests while they\u0027re sleeping and chill there for awhile. Jones is no couch potato, though! This is one on-the-go dude who loves to play with toys on a stick and chase after ping pong balls. He also likes to chase and play-fight with other male cats and wrestle all over the place. When Jones meets a new cat, sometimes he gets a little hissy at first to assert his dominance, but he usually warms up to other felines after everyone understands the pecking order. This, however, is not the case around dogs. Jones gets spooked and immediately defensive around dogs; he\u0027ll hiss and swat, but only if they get too close. Jones\u0027 perfect home would be one that has another male cat about his size for him to run around and play with. He\u0027s prone to getting into mischief if he gets bored, and having a BFF (best feline friend) around will help keep him in line. Jones\u0027 history is also a big question mark, so we\u0027re not really sure why he gets very skittish sometimes. Things like loud unexpected noises near him, other animals (especially dogs) and unfamiliar people that don\u0027t respect his space tend to make Jones defensive and prone to using his claws. With time, this is improving (especially the more he meets new human friends!), but he\u0027d be best suited to an experienced cat owner who understands that sometimes cats just need some room to get used to things. If you\u0027ve got a male cat that could use a partner in crime and a chest that could use a furry heating pad while you sleep, Jones might just be the cat you\u0027re looking for! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

Fushia loves to roll over and show you her adorable white splotches of fur for some stomach scratches. Her favorite game is hide and go seek! But if you wait too long to find her, she\u0027ll pull a sneak attack and jump out from her hiding place. Fushia truly enjoys the companionship of another person. She\u0027s an expert level cuddler and does well with some friendly encouragement. Fushia would do best in a home with another welcoming adult cat to help her come out of her shell.

    "description": "Greetings from Fizzbo! He\u0027s an explorer ready to carve a path right into your heart. His all black coat, confidence, and bravery make him appear as if he\u0027s a mini black panther! And just like any big cat, he loves to climb and seek out his next adventure! Currently, Fizzbo has taken a liking to his foster\u0027s children. Sometimes he thinks he\u0027s one of them as he plays right alongside. He does have a whim of curiosity, so he would be a good fit in a home with another play partner to keep him entertained. But don\u0027t worry, he\u0027s not all macho cat. Fizzbo is fond of sweet kitty cuddles with his beloved humans too. Keep him close to your heart, that\u0027s his favorite! Contact us today to meet Fizzbo! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Fizzbo, please email [email protected]",

She also has a bold stripe down her nose, quite a lovely contrast to the palette of her tortie coat. Numbat is a sweet baby of a kitten! She is the smallest in her family, and hangs back to let her siblings take the lead. But she is starting to come out of her shell and be more confident! We suspect that until she was rescued and placed in a loving foster home, she had never played - now she chases jingle balls, goes a-rumpus-ing with her sisters, and plays with great joy and cuteness. Watching her blossom is beautiful. Oh, and cuddling! She\u0027s a cuddler.

She loves to wrestle but will cuddle up and purr in your lap just as easily; she\u0027s great with kids, too! Marshmallow Matey has been well socialized at her foster home and is barely fazed by the enthusiastic 70-lb dog - and is intrigued by the resident adult cat!

    "description": "Sweet, Playful, Gentle Say hello to Fourth! This little cutie has been mastering her social skills. While she\u0027s not a lap cat quite yet, she enjoys attention-especially if you shake that treat bag. Fourth also has a TON of kitten energy. Her favorite toys are catnip balls and mice that chirp. And when she runs out of steam, she likes to plop down for a nice nap. Fourth likes to cuddle and play with other cats. In fact, she\u0027d probably feel most comfortable in a house where she has a feline companion. She\u0027s also okay with older kids, but prefers if they approach her slowly. She\u0027s made so much progress with her social skills. Now she just needs to find a loving forever home with the patience and space she needs to grow. Do you have room for a sweet, soft lady? All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Princess was literally rescued from the street with her two siblings. Starting out as an unsocialized kitten, it took her a while to get used to people; but once she realized people meant her no harm, she couldn\u0027t stop mewing for more pets, loving, and kitty massages! It may take her a period of time to get used to new people, but once you earn her trust, she yours - and she\u0027s a gem! Princess is a pretty little dilute tortoiseshell (\"tortie\") with a delicate white face. When she was rescued she had a broken pelvis, which causes weakness in her hind legs; sometimes she will drag them. However, she is improving by the day, and may possibly regain full function! To see more about Princess, check her out on Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/preciousfosters/ Princess is quirky and playful, but is also down to chill with you on the couch or bed. And for being the smallest in her family, she has a huge purr - like a motorboat! She is very talkative and will mew to welcome you into a room, or back at you if you speak to her. She is a good cat-versationalist! Princess is very good with children as long as they are quiet and gentle with her. She can be picked up and petted without a problem. She would probably do well in a calm, low-traffic home with another friendly cat, as well as loving and kind people. Contact us today to meet Princess! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Princess, please email [email protected]",

    "description": "Galaxy is solid white, like one pure star - not a spot of any other color on her! She is a little shy when you meet her, but once she warms up she will charm you with her totally sweet disposition. Galaxy loves-loves-LOVES to play with her kitten friends! Because she is still working through her skittish side, she isn\u0027t the best companion for little kids or hyper dogs. She will need some time to adjust to a new home, people, and animals, so just plan to be patient and you definitely will be rewarded! Galaxy is an expert at head boops, booty skritches and purrs bigger than she is. She gets along just fine with dogs over time!! Contact us today to meet Galaxy!

    "description": "With those cute white tufts of fur floofing out of her ears, Aileen resembles a little bobcat! She came to APA! very shy and is still learning to trust people, but she is really making an effort and makes great strides every week. Aileen is friendly and will cuddle in your lap! She also likes to burrow under blankets or pillows for some personal snuggle time. Aileen has been fine around the older kids she has met, as well as other friendly cats and even nice dogs! She is still coming out of her shell, so her human companion should be patient and help her develop trust on her own timetable. Contact us today to meet Aileen! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Aileen, please email [email protected]",

    "description": "Dainty, Chatty, Affectionate Sweet Miss Shelby\u0027s history is a mystery, but one thing is for sure - this stray has transformed herself into the perfect little house cat! She was found wandering in a neighborhood without tags or a chip, but she\u0027s been an indoor cat at some point in her life because she absolutely knows the sound of a can of food being opened! She\u0027s extremely friendly, has perfect litter box manners and deserves a second chance at being a spoiled indoor kitty. Shelby loves to play with any toy that\u0027s around, but has a preference for wand toys and things she can carry around in her mouth like \"prey.\" She\u0027s currently living with a kitten and has the energy level to keep up with them, so you know she loves her playtime! When she\u0027s done pretending to be a ferocious outdoor cat carrying around her trophy, she likes to curl up in your lap and stay as long as you\u0027ll let her. She loves being petted and receiving any love you have to give, but is perfectly happy just to spend time close to you. Shelby gets the most chatty around meal times, but will talk to you while you go about your business around the house as well. Shelby has met multiple cats and has no problem playing with the friendly ones or avoiding the grumpy ones. She hasn\u0027t met kids or dogs yet, but given her street-smarts and affectionate nature, would most likely be alright with other critters that can respect her space. Shelby\u0027s perfect home would be one with another cat for her to play with, so she can keep her predator skills in tip-top shape! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Shelby, please email [email protected]",

She also likes to sleep with her human companion at night. She is talkative and purr-ative, which is how she shows you affection. She likes for you to brush her and doesn\u0027t mind being picked up and held. That said, she has a streak of independence and won\u0027t hang out with you all the time. Willa likes to play, too, especially with string toys and balls - she will chase them until she captures them! She would do well with a vertical scratching post in her new home. She is a rather mellow gal who has been tolerant around kids and other cats, but dogs scare her a bit. We are still getting to know Willa; contact us today to arrange a meet \u0026 greet and get to know her, too! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Willa, please email [email protected]",

    "description": "Affectionate, young-at-heart, playful Age is just a number - just ask Evelyn. You would think this spunky and playful girl is a kitten! Her personal favorite toys are crinkle balls, string toys, and catnip (obviously!). Evelyn is a special cat because she loves to be around people and close to you, but she isn\u0027t overly needy and desperate for attention. One of Evelyn\u0027s cutest quirks is her head bumps. She\u0027ll give you an adorable little nudge when she wants some love. She\u0027s also very chatty when it comes to feeding time and is almost always purring. Evelyn is super friendly, affectionate, and people-oriented! But she is stressed very easily (who can relate?); she doesn\u0027t love dogs or other cats so would likely be best as an only pet. She would be perfect for someone who wants a low-maintenance companion! If Evelyn sounds like the spunky lady you\u0027ve been searching for, don\u0027t hesitate to meet her! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Evelyn, please email [email protected]",
