    "description": "Content, Quiet, Special Winnie is a mellow and happy girl. She likes to watch the world go by from her window perch (aka Cat TV), to chase the laser light, and to battle string toys. She plays with other cats but prefers privacy when she takes a nap. And if you have a vacant lap, she will take up residence in it and purr! Winnie was born with Manx Syndrome, a defect that causes her to be incontinent. This means she needs a compassionate owner who will help her express her urine a few times a day; this sounds harder than it actually is, and APA! will provide instruction on how to do it. Winnie doesn\u0027t have a tail, which is totally cute, but it is also helpful in keeping her clean - she is so accommodating! Winnie has beautiful green eyes and a sweet demeanor. She must always remain an indoor cat, but she does like to bask outside in a protected, enclosed area, such as a chicken coop or a rabbit hutch (without the chickens or rabbits, of course!). If you are looking to adopt a wonderful cat who also has special needs, we think you should meet Winnie. She will completely love you back. Contact us to meet her today! All APA! cats and kittens are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Loving, Playful, Adorable Say hello to sweet little Gracie! This gorgeous girl just wants to be with you. She\u0027ll follow you around the house, even patiently sitting outside the shower. She likes to snuggle up beside you or lay by your feet. She enjoys equal parts of playtime and nap time. She bats at mice on strings and chases other toys on her own. Gracie is a special kitty with special needs. She was left incontinent after a car accident and has limited use of her back legs. Because of her condition, Gracie needs to have her bladder expressed twice a day; and since she can\u0027t quite groom her rear end, she would greatly benefit from having a monthly shave back there to prevent matting (she\u0027s such a fluffy girl!). She has few troubles with the litter box - she kicks litter and sometimes misses the box. Sometimes when you\u0027re in the bathroom, Gracie will come running so she can have her potty time, too! She knows the drill. She is a smart, willing girl who handles her differences with dignity, and she is looking for her human companion who can do the same. Gracie has not met any children or dogs, and has enjoyed being with other cats who aren\u0027t dominant and don\u0027t bully her; sometimes other cats try to bully her, which is not nice at all, especially since Gracie is such a nice girl! Because she enjoys the company of other cats, it would be great to find a home with a cat who would accept her and be her buddy. She\u0027d be the perfect cat for someone who wants a truly loving and devoted companion. This total sweetheart is waiting to meet her best friend and find her ideal forever home. If you\u0027re looking to make a huge difference in a little kitty\u0027s life, contact us today to meet Gracie. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Friendly, Cuddler, Precious They don\u0027t call this kitty O\u0027Purry for nothing! This sweetheart adores cuddling in your lap and purring away. O\u0027Purry has some special needs that make her different than your typical cat. But, her desire for affection and love are the same as any people-loving kitty as well as her happy purr. Being different doesn\u0027t matter to O\u0027Purry, but being loved most certainly does. O\u0027Purry has a condition that is called Manx Syndrome. This means she was born without a tail and a shorter spine than most cats which has caused her to be fecally incontinent, and she also needs her bladder expressed a couple of times a day -- we know that sounds scary, but don\u0027t worry! Her foster and our vets will walk you through how to care for O\u0027Purry and her special needs. O\u0027Purry is easy to express and has no problems as long as you express her regularly (morning, lunch, after work and before bed). She will probably have to wear a diaper her entire life, but she doesn\u0027t let that stop her. She is a brave kitty, takes all of this all in stride, and still plays like a happy, confident kitten! O\u0027Purry, because of her shortened spine, also walks a bit differently than other cats. She gets around just fine, and is cute as a button! She moves more like a rabbit than a cat and can be heard hopping around from downstairs. She is able to climb up a cat tree but has to work hard to jump up on a chair. She loves to play with balls and mice and likes other cats. When O\u0027Purry finishes her kitty games, she will seek out your lap to sit and then the o\u0027purry sets in and she purrs and purrs with delight! Caring for a special needs pet may take less time and money than you think... and the life you\u0027ll save is priceless along with the love that you\u0027ll receive. Contact APA! to find out more about O\u0027Purry and to set up a meet and greet with the purriest of kitties today! All APA! kittens are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Outgoing, Goofy, Cat-Social Holly George has the cutest booty! He is an orange tabby/Manx mix so his tail is super short, giving him an adorable bunny bum. He is affectionate with all people and loves to be petted. In fact, he will tap you on the arm to request for you to pet him! He also will give you nose kisses - touch his nose gently and sweetly to yours - to let you know how much he loves you. Super sweet and loving! Holly George has Manx Syndrome; basically, the gene that gave him his short tail also shortened his spine, which caused him to be incontinent and unable to pee on his own. This is where you come in! His human needs to \"express - apply light pressure in a particular way - Holly George\u0027s bladder a few times a day to help him urinate. For more information, please contact APA! In addition to people, Holly George is social with other cats, too, and would love to have a feline buddy (or two) to hang out with in his new home. He has grown up around cats of all ages and accepts all of them. He will snuggle with them and groom them, and he will play with them, too! He also likes a variety of toys - balls, string toys, feather toys - and a scratching post to scratch and climb. He is young and active! Holly George has some special needs, and we think the perfect home for him is with patient people who will love and appreciate him! His human companion should be able to express his bladder and keep him clean (he is a little sensitive around his back end, so he likes to be handled gently); other than that, all Holly George needs is company, love and affection, and to be played with. He would be best with adults and young adults, rather than little kids. Though Holly George is friendly and outgoing, he likely will need time to adapt to his new home and family. But once he is comfortable, we think you will agree that he is an over-the-top wonderful cat! Contact us today for more information, and to set up a meet and greet. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Are you looking for a spitfire companion full of sass? Do you have a soft spot for heartthrobs with checkered pasts? Would you like to take a walk on the wild side? Then meet Boris, Austin\u0027s very own beautiful bad boy with a heart of gold! Like most bad boys, Boris has had a few run-ins with the law; when you look deeper, though, you can easily get past the naughty exterior to see his perspective. Before he came to APA!, Boris had the misfortune of having his front paws declawed, and he\u0027s understandably upset about this turn of events. Without his claws, Boris can\u0027t defend himself the same way that other cats can. The world is a lot scarier when you feel helpless, and poor Boris suffers from some anxiety problems that cause him to lash out using the only defense he has left- his teeth. Boris does have a bite history, and will need a compassionate adopter who is willing to look past his bad habits. In return, however, Boris will reveal his heart of gold and reward his family with all of the love, snuggles, and head butts anyone could ask for. At heart, this bad boy is really a snuggle bug, who loves to be pet, scratched, and brushed, and who will even put his paws on your shoulders to give you a hug! Boris is a staff favorite at APA!, and many of the cat program counselors have fallen in love with him as he climbed on their shoulders or took a snooze on their laps. Funny and quirky, this boy loves to take the spotlight with his playful antics. He can often be found chasing balls around his enclosure, wrestling with his roommates, or stealing all the attention of anyone who comes to visit. Boris, with his dreamy fluffy white fur and striking splashes of orange tabby stripes, knows that he deserves the spotlight, and will demand it! Boris does well with other cats in the shelter, but needs to be in an animal-free home - he wants to be the center of your attention. Boris is absolutely not interested in kids of any species! This bachelor is childfree for life and proud of it, and will not be adopted to a home with children. Because of his struggles with fear-based aggression, he takes an easy once-daily anxiety medication that has helped him enormously. On the medication, Boris is much more comfortable with the world around him and much more able to be the sweetheart we know he is inside. What Boris really needs, however, is someone in his corner who will be patient and compassionate, who will protect him and make him feel comfortable and loved, and who will act as his advocate to the world and understand his needs. If this sounds like you, come meet Boris today! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Boris, please email [email protected]",

    "description": "Affectionate - Curious - Graceful If Osage were able to describe his perfect forever home, it would include cuddling at all hours and laps to lounge in! He\u0027s a lovable fellow, and thrives on snuggles and attention from his humans. With feline grace, he flows more like liquid when he\u0027s being affectionate. He\u0027ll start with his cheek and the rest of him follows as he winds around your legs! Osage is laidback and would be a great fit for a warm and quiet household. Not one to play with toys, he\u0027d rather indulge his curious nature by exploring his surroundings and hunting out the best nooks to lounge in. He\u0027ll contentedly lay out with a loud purr, though you aren\u0027t likely to catch him meowing. Osage is super friendly with humans and is learning how to live with both cats and dogs in his current foster home. He seems to warm up to dog friends more quickly than cat friends but with time we believe he would become accustomed to any four-legged companion. The third time\u0027s the charm for Osage, as this golden-eyed sweetheart has been surrendered twice. He first came to the shelter as a bottle baby and was adopted for two years before being recently returned when his owner was unable to bring him along during a move. Stressed by the shelter environment, he\u0027s in need of a truly affectionate forever home! If you\u0027re ready to love and be loved by Osage, pay him a visit! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Nurturing - Independent - Sassy Alfreda lost her forever home when her human passed away; she was left home alone for weeks before someone found her and nursed her back to health. Although she\u0027s been through a rough patch, Alfreda is a resilient gal who has bounced back and is ready for a new forever home. Once Alfreda came to APA!, it was discovered that she is wonderful with other cats - she loves kittens and has even nursed a few. She also cuddles up to senior hospice cats. Perhaps she empathizes with other felines who have also had a tough time or perhaps she simply likes other cats; either way, she\u0027d be great in a multi-cat home, provided the other cats are as easygoing as she is. Of course, Alfreda does have her limits and she\u0027s not afraid to let you know if she\u0027s over something by swatting with her paw. She enjoys being around people, but she\u0027s not a big cuddler and doesn\u0027t have time for kids who aren\u0027t cat savvy. She will let you know if she wants to be petted - she needs humans who will respect her bodily integrity, please. Alfreda would prefer a forever home with adults who can appreciate her independent, funny, and sometimes sassy personality. In turn, she will reward you with a very low-maintenance companion with an adorably serious-yet-smooshy face. While she loves to throw down with toy mice, she\u0027s past the crazy kitten stage and will actually let you sleep at night. Alfreda has excellent litter box and scratching manners. Despite her sassy nature, she will let you trim her nails without too much protest. She has a wonderfully gravelly voice (think Bea Arthur with whiskers) and loves to chat over a good meal. Alfreda has shown great strength and character during the most trying time in her life; now this broad is seeking a forever home where her humans will respect her space, enjoy her company, and toss a few mice around for her. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Purr-Master, Sweetheart, Snuggler There\u0027s no doubt that George Ezra\u0027s charming personality and quirky kitty ways would inspire his human namesake to sing a song about him. There\u0027s just something about a vibrant orange fluffball happily climbing into your lap, kneading away and drifting off to sleep that makes you feel all cozy and...well...that just makes you want to sing! George not only adores people, he loves playing with other cats and to snuggle and get baths from them. He also enjoys gazing out the window with a kitty friend by his side. He has a wonderful purr and is just as content snuggling and sleeping as he is playing. When George does play, he loves a go-round with a rascally string toy or trying to take down those pesky laser pointers! George is FeLV+ (Feline Leukemia Virus), which causes a weakened immune system and requires special care. APA! provides some medical assistance after adoption. Cats with FeLV typically have a shortened lifespan. George is not contagious to people or dogs, but should live only with other FeLV+ cats. For more information, please contact APA! or read more by our Partner, Best Friends Animal Society: http://bestfriends.org/Resources/FAQs-About-Feline-Leukemia-Virus-FeLV/ George is under the weather sometimes and takes medication that helps him feel better. He is such a lovebug, you won\u0027t find a sweeter cat! This little fellow also has impeccable manners, always using his litterbox and only scratching his toys, not the furniture! George would absolutely thrive in a loving home where a lap or two is readily available and with human friends who are comfortable giving him the medical care he needs to keep this precious guy as healthy as possible. Young kids may be a bit much for him, but gentle older children and adults would most certainly keep his purr motor going strong. Contact APA! today to meet this orange delight! All APA! kittens are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

She\u0027s a senior gal who is more interested in naps and pets than in racing about the house and bouncing off walls. She can be a little shy at first, but once she has gotten to know you, you could not ask for a more affectionate cat. She loves to be curled up by your side while you watch Netflix, or read a good book, or play X-box. Mia loves attention, and would love a home where her special people are home a lot to give her the affection she craves. She would be the perfect fit for a housebound senior, or a young professional who has a home office! Or a homemaker who will let her sit at their side as they take care of their house. Mia has Chronic Renal Disease, which means her kidneys are not functioning as well as they once were. This condition is so common in older cats that APA! offers a special adoption package for them. Read more about renal failure and adoption details here: http://www.austinpetsalive.org/2016/03/lives-worth-saving-cats-in-renal-failure We can tell you this: it will be well worth the extra care to have this sweet face greet you at the door every day. Mia gets along fine with the other cats in the cattery, so would do well with a calm feline companion with a similar low-key activity level. Or she could flourish as an only cat, and keep all your attention for herself! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip.

    "description": "Curious, Affectionate, Patient If you are looking for a cat overflowing with personality, Hector can deliver that - and more! When Hector first goes home with you, he will probably hide for a bit, so be gentle and patient with him. He doesn\u0027t mind if you seek him out in his safe hidey-hole; he will accept your petting! This is how you prove to him that you are a trustworthy human (we suspect people in his previous life were not trustworthy or dependable). And once he trusts you, he will seek YOU out for petting; he may even be a little pushy about it! Eventually, he will become your total lap cat. And not only that! When Hector relaxes and is comfortable in his new home, he will purr constantly! If he is not in your lap, he is content to sit across the room from you, gazing at you with love, making little cooing sounds at you. How cute is that!? Hector knows his name and will respond when you call him. He is mostly a mellow guy, but just when you think you have defined him, he will change it up; he may run around the house, chasing who-knows-what, playfully throwing his toys around, jumping up on things to get a better view of his domain! Hector has an ulcer on his tongue that makes it look like he is sticking his tongue out. We don\u0027t know if it is due to genetics, his immune system, or allergies; it is stubborn to completely heal, so a biopsy will be done to figure out what it is and what can be done to get it to heal. Hector is a healthy FIV+ (Feline Immunodeficiency Virus) cat. FIV+ cats typically live long, healthy lives! For more information, please contact APA! or read this FAQ: http://bestfriends.org/Resources/FAQs-About-Feline-Immunodeficiency-Virus-FIV Hector needs a low-traffic home with patient, cat-experienced adults. He seems interested in other cats, but we don\u0027t know how he interacts with them. He has good scratching habits and would do best with a large litter box, or even one with a cover. Hector is quirky and loving and talkative, quite simply a GREAT cat! He loves his people once you get through that getting-to-know-you period. He is alert, curious, and inquisitive. And fabulous and silly! We could go on and on, but contact us to meet him for yourself! Your cup will runneth over. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Affectionate, Sweet, Regal Muffin is a love muffin! She needs a little time to warm up to you, but once she does she will be looking to give \"rubby-rubs to her humans and will happily accept a good ear and chin rub in return. When you get home she will greet you at the door and she will guard your bed with every inch of her body when you\u0027re sleeping. This lovely senior lady really knows how to make you feel special! Muffin is low-maintenance and is very energetic for a cat her age. She loves to play, especially with her favorite toy which is simple, yet so entertaining...a good ol\u0027 piece of string. She could give much younger cats lessons in proper string pouncing--none of that on the floor stuff, she catches hers while it\u0027s still up in the air! Muffin doesn\u0027t scratch on furniture and is a pro at using the litter box. She\u0027s quiet most of the time, but will start talking when she gets hungry. When it comes to being petted, she doesn\u0027t like for you to try and pet her from an angle she can\u0027t see and would prefer that you don\u0027t touch her pretty tortie tail. But, she is happy to accept love from you, as long as it\u0027s given on her terms! The ideal home for Muffin would include a patient adopter who is willing to give her time to acclimate to her new surroundings. Muffin would be comfortable with older kids who give her the space she needs, but younger children would be a bit much for this old gal. Muffin isn\u0027t happy when she sees the other cats in her foster home. So, she may have been the only kitty in her previous household and would likely do best as the solo cat. A low-energy dog would probably be fine if a slow introduction is made. Give Muffin the love and understanding she needs and she\u0027ll spend the rest of her life returning the favor tenfold to her most special and adored person...you! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Muffin, please email [email protected]",

    "description": "Sweet, Senior, Social We can\u0027t tell you about Anderson\u0027s past because she was found as a stray by a Good Samaritan, but we can tell you that she is a sweet old girl! She may look big and tough in her photo, but she\u0027s actually petite. When Anderson first came to APA!, she was purring so loudly that the technicians giving her a physical couldn\u0027t hear her heartbeat! She is appreciative of the attention she receives, and will quietly lean into you for more pets. She is social and likes to be around people. Anderson likes being petted on her head, but prefers that you don\u0027t touch her legs or tail. She will lick you and give you kitty kisses, though sometimes the kisses turn into love nips - all the while purring! Then she will lick you again. Finally, she will sit in your lap, again with her trademark purring; which seems to get louder, the happier she is. She does all this to show you that she has accepted you as her special human companion. Anderson is good with other cats that leave her alone, so she should be be able to live with another cat, as long as they respect her and don\u0027t bully her. Because of her love nips, little kids should be supervised around her, but she should be fine with older kids who understand and appreciate her quirks. Don\u0027t think that because of her age that Anderson isn\u0027t playful, because she would prove you wrong! Stick toys are her favorite. She will do her version of running after it (walking quickly), bat it around, pounce on it, bite it, and subdue it. Anderson also gets very excited about wet food and treats! She has perfect litter box habits, though she needs a large box with high sides and/or a cover, because she will hang her hiney over the box - crouching is hard for her, so this will keep her inside the box and accident-free. So we don\u0027t know what kind of life Anderson had before, but we know for sure the remainder of her life should be with people who would love an older-yet-still-spunky cat as their feline companion. Contact us today to set up a meet and greet with this lovely senior! Anderson has her own Instagram! Check her out: https://www.instagram.com/oldmissandi All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip.

    "description": "Affectionate, Mannerly, Lap Cat Hayden loves being around people because 1) they have a lap, and 2) they give pets! In his world, head scratches are the best. He will step all over your tummy or laptop, if you\u0027re working, to get your attention. But he is super sweet and gentle about it! Hayden is a handsome fellow, always dressed to the nines in a tasteful gray tux. You can tell he\u0027s got the Emily Post manners thing down, because he uses the litter box like a gent, and he minds the furniture as well. Right-o! Hayden has diabetes and requires some extra medical care, which may include regulated diet and/or insulin. For more information, please contact APA! But he is splendid about taking his medicine. No fuss at all. That would be bad form. He is rather enthusiastic about food, which is probably caused by the diabetes; but of course he is polite and well-behaved about it. And he\u0027s an affectionate cuddler. If he could talk, he\u0027d probably recite a bit of Shelley or Byron while lounging in your lap. His ideal home would be with someone who would love him and give him affection. He would do likely be fine with other pets, and even kids. Contact us today to set up a meet and greet - you won\u0027t be able to resist his puppy-dog eyes! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip.

    "description": "Curious, Docile, Loving If you are looking to love a unique cat and can accept his disabilities as part of his charm - and give him the care he requires - Dexter is the cat for you! Dexter had to have one eye removed and has limited vision in the remaining eye, has shortened front legs that affect his mobility and the way he walks, and has an occasional seizure. If you couldn\u0027t already guess, Dexter has had a hard life - he wasn\u0027t treated well and didn\u0027t get the medical care he needed. The good news - the great news! - is that Dexter is an affectionate, social, and relaxed guy. He\u0027s actually pretty low-maintenance now that his medical issues have been addressed. Because of his short legs he can\u0027t climb into a litter box - balancing in litter is hard for him, too - but he\u0027s been successful using pee pads (he prefers his pee pad to be in a non-carpeted location). Sometimes he doesn\u0027t make it there in time, but it\u0027s not because he isn\u0027t trying. His human companion needs to be okay with this. Dexter will meow when he wants dinner and will follow you around; he has a wobbly, stumbly walk that is endearing and comical. Being close to you is important to him, so you can expect that he will lie on the floor at your feet, waiting patiently for you to pet him. He especially likes for you to pet him around his face and tail; rub his face, and he will lick you. He doesn\u0027t care for being picked up (it makes him nervous), and prefers to get his petting on the floor. Dexter doesn\u0027t play much, but that might change as he gets used to you and his new home; recently, he has been seen \"running\" (his version of running) from room-to-room in his foster home, so his foster family is planning to encourage him in some gentle games. He will move around the house to drink water, eat food, and use the pee pad, but otherwise he likes to find a comfy spot and hang out there all day, grooming himself now and then. Dexter lives with a dog in his foster home, and will sleep as close to him as he can (within six inches)! He probably wouldn\u0027t like a home with a very active dog, but he is cool with a cat-friendly, mellow pup. Similarly, Dexter is not the companion for a child. He lived with other cats in his previous life (though we don\u0027t know how they got along), but he seems fine and dandy as the only cat. Dexter is not the cat for you if you are not cat-experienced and able to love him and accommodate his special needs. His home should not have any stairs, since he can\u0027t navigate them and doesn\u0027t want to be carried around. He embodies courage and determination, maneuvering around despite his disabilities. He is relaxed and adorable, and just wants to live a comfortable life. If you can provide this for him, he will love you forever and leave a little paw print on your heart, every day. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Shy, Curious, Playful Chulo is a beautiful, jet black senior kitty with bright green eyes! She is looking for a patient and kind human to help her come out of her shell; the key to her heart is gentle petting and lots of love. Chulo spent her life in a loving home with other cats and dogs, but sadly, her human passed away, and Chulo\u0027s life completely changed. She is understandably nervous about new places and people since leaving her home. When you meet her, it might be on her terms; she may have found a safe place to hide for a while - like under a bed - until she feels safe and comfortable. But she doesn\u0027t mind if you pet her while she rests in her hidey-hole! Chulo has a strong, happy purr and can be quite affectionate with people she trusts. She is very polite, uses her litterbox consistently, plays with toys, and takes advantage of scratching posts instead of furniture. Chulo is a sweet kitty who\u0027s ready to settle in to her forever home! She would do best in a quiet, low-traffic home and would probably mesh well with other easy-going cats (she\u0027s doing great with the younger cat who is sharing her foster home!), and maybe even a cat-friendly dog. She takes a while to warm up, but if you\u0027re patient she\u0027ll reward you with plenty of purrs! Contact us today to arrange a meet and greet with Chulo. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Gentle, Sweet, Beautiful Marlena is a beautiful calico cat with very soft fur, eyes that are a lovely shade of green and she has really cute facial expressions. She is a very sweet and gentle dignified older lady who is a little shy at first. With time and patience she comes out of her shell and is very friendly. She likes to sit next to her foster mom and \"helps\" when she is working on her laptop. She is a cuddly sleeper and will give a big purr when she gets petted. She is not particularly playful but does enjoy a little play with a catnip toy from time to time and really loves and needs some sort of scratching post/board. For the most part, she likes to take it easy but meal time and treat time get her super excited. She generally doesn\u0027t like other cats but is not aggressive when she gets to know them. It is unknown how she would feel about dogs or children but all indications are she would not be a fan. She would probably prefer a home when she gets to be the only pet and queen of the castle. Marlena has diabetes and was left at the shelter due to the diagnosis. She just needs a quite home with loving humans who can give her a little special attention and love. She requires some extra medical care which includes a regulated diet and insulin injections along with monitoring. She appears to have some limited vision which is customary for diabetic cats.

Behind those gorgeous peepers is a deep thinker...cautious, because how can you know whether friend or foe at first, second or third glance? Yet, wanting and hoping to be able to trust because that\u0027s when all the fun and love happen! Baby Boi relishes soft strokes, especially around his jaw and head, and he\u0027ll happily play with kids and adults when he feels confident he\u0027s among friends. You won\u0027t meet a gentler soul or a sweeter one! Baby Boi isn\u0027t big on cuddles, but he will allow you to sneak some in now and then. He\u0027s never aggressive, even when he\u0027s scared. When it comes to being active, he\u0027s more of a sit back and ponder kind than a high energy type. But, he will confidently speak up if he\u0027s in the mood for playing or some tlc. Baby Boi doesn\u0027t like the company of other cats. So, he\u0027d do best in a household where he\u0027s your one and only feline baby. If you\u0027re willing to let Baby Boi get to know you at his own pace, you will be richly rewarded for your time and patience with a friendly, sweetheart of a kitty. If he sounds like the kind of boy you could wrap your heart around, contact us to set up a meet and greet with Baby Boi today!

It was shortly discovered that she was not pregnant but instead had a huge belly from fluid build up secondary to not enough protein in her diet. Since she got here, she has been treated for mange and is loving and friendly. A little too friendly because she love bites when excited:) She would make a great cat in a dog free home. She is terrified of dogs. She is being treated for mange and will go home with meds to finish that up. The mange is only contagious to other cats, not dogs or people so she is safe to take now. She has beautiful green eyes and when her whiskers and fur completely grows back, she will be a looker! Can you give her a place to call home?",

    "description": "Sweet, sometimes dorky, languorous Munchkin is content to lie as close to you as humanly (or felinely) possible and napping for a good long time, while reserving the right to be lovingly stroked and/or brushed, also for a good long time. She loves to be petted for as long as your hand can last (she always wins that game), and will purrrrrrr to let you know you\u0027re doing it \"right\". She will even lick your hand a little, grooming you as a reward for giving her pets. She is a beautiful, soft, fluffy, cuddly brown tortie, so petting her is a reward in itself. While some cats like to be busy exploring, playing, chasing, leaping, etc., that best describes Munchkin\u0027s past rather than her present. She\u0027s probably had enough fun, chased enough jingly balls and leapt upon enough devious laser dots to last a lifetime. Fifteen years, to be exact. She\u0027s earned a rest. Being the mild-mannered sweetheart that she is, Munchkin doesn\u0027t much care for excitable cats or dogs, and children would likely overwhelm her. Munchkin is looking to be the only pet in a quiet home where she can be doted on as she deserves! Previous to her stay with APA!, Munchkin\u0027s front paws had been declawed. As a result of this, she must remain an indoor cat. Munchkin does have some arthritis in her spine, which can cause discomfort and difficulty getting around, but she\u0027s now on medication for it and is feeling better. When she\u0027s in pain, she occasionally will let you know by relieving herself outside of her litterbox or on her bed. So, a little extra clean up is needed now and then. Having limited forms of communication doesn\u0027t leave many options when it comes to letting your humans know that you\u0027re hurting. She is showing some signs of early-stage kidney issues, but with a proper diet and treatment, she may well have years of cuddling left! Hey, we all get a little creaky as we get older, but we also start to realize there\u0027s nothing better than loving and being loved! And loving you is just what Munchkin wants to spend her life doing! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Munchkin, please email us at [email protected]",

    "description": "Big Boy, Super Chill, Likes to be Loved On Poor Louie has been in his enclosure for too long! He needs room to run and play, and he\u0027s bored to tears! Well, OK, not tears, but some occasional crabby behavior. You\u0027d be grumpy, too, if you were cooped up with no freedom in sight. Louie does like playing with toys and with his bunkmate Danny Boy, but he just tolerates the other cats in his enclosure. They have occasional skirmishes, though we can\u0027t tell who the instigator is. Louie also seeks human attention, and really enjoys being loved on. We think he\u0027d be good with older, respectful kids, especially if they play with him. We haven\u0027t seen him with dogs. Louie would be so happy to finally have a forever home of his own! We know he really is a good kitty - he just needs room to run and people to give him the attention he needs. He\u0027d like to go home with his buddy Danny Boy - having a familiar friend at his side would help him transition to a new environment more easily. Danny Boy has his own bio, so check it out! You can see pictures and action videos of Louie, Danny Boy, and their other kitty buddies on this Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/NutterButtercat/ All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip.

    "description": "Loving, Calm, Sweet \"Love me tender, love me sweet...put me in your lap...\" Elvis has modified the song to fit her cuddly ways! She is such a snuggler whether it\u0027s a lap, your chest or being held in your arms. Reach out and touch her and her purr motor is immediately activated and continues strong and happy as you love on her and as she hopes you never let her go! Elvis may not be the youngest kitty around, but she is as full of life and love as any cat you\u0027ll meet. She\u0027s a very mellow lady whose favorite activity is hanging out with her humans and being petted by them. People find Elvis\u0027 charms irresistible and she also has fans in the animal world. The skittish kitty in her foster home, who doesn\u0027t tolerate the presence of just any cat, amicably relaxes in the same room as Elvis. Then there\u0027s the calm puppy Elvis recently met, they were friends in no time! Elvis does prefer mellow company over high energy acquaintances. So, she would get along best with a cat or dog who has a laid back temperament similar to her own. She would likely to well with respectful, calm children who handle her gently. Elvis has diabetes which is easily managed with a special diet, no insulin shots are needed. You may ask yourself why a gorgeous girl would be named Elvis. We think the answer is in the shape of those alluring eyes of hers and that magnificent profile...very much like the King himself! Elvis would be an outstanding companion cat in a tranquil, loving home. Her purrs will melt away your stress and her serene, affectionate presence will add sweetness to every day. Contact us to meet Elvis and you\u0027ll soon be singing \" I...can\u0027t...help...falling in love...with...you.\" All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip.

    "description": "Mellow, sociable, wise Not long ago, Austin Pets Alive! took in eight (count \u0027em, eight) cats whose owner had just passed away. Seven of them have been adopted. We\u0027d like you to meet number eight. His name is Lily. Yes, \"His.\" And yes, \"Lily.\" Having lived with so many cats, Lily does just fine with newcomers of his species, but isn\u0027t all that interested in snuggling or playing. It\u0027s as if he\u0027s saying, \"Hello there, my name is Lily. Yes...yes...Lily. I get asked that a lot. What do you say we just sit for a while on this nice, soft carpet and take in all the interesting things that are going on in the house? Which reminds me, when\u0027s dinner?\" Of course, Lily has had plenty of experience with humans as well, so he\u0027s perfectly comfortable in their presence...although his preference seems to be sitting NEXT to them rather than ON them. Either way, he\u0027s very pleasant company. Lily\u0027s back is somewhat tender, and he has a bit of arthritis in his hips for which he takes supplements and pain meds. So if his new home does have any children, we\u0027d recommend the gentler the better. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip.

    "description": "Sweet, cuddly, quiet If ever there was a kitty that could use the warmth, patience and understanding of a loving home, it\u0027s this 7-year-old sweetie-pie named Coco. When Coco first arrived at APA! she not only had arthritis and a congenital bone deformity in her front feet, she was thin enough to need some extra nutrition as well. So in addition to pain meds for her arthritis, Coco also requires a special prescription diet of both wet and dry food to keep her gaining weight and improving her overall health. And so far, so good. Yet even with all that stacked against her, Coco has proven herself to be the sweetest, most mellow and affectionate companion anyone could wish for. After just a few weeks of shyness with her current foster, her comfort and confidence level has risen dramatically. Sure, Coco\u0027s oddly shaped front feet slow her down a bit compared to other kitties, but it sure doesn\u0027t keep her from zipping to her food dish at mealtime! (Guess she likes that special diet.) She needs help getting up onto the bed she likes to cuddle on, but she can jump down just fine. And not being a staircase-bounder-upper gives her that much more time for some of her favorite things: making biscuits on a nice, soft blanket; napping like an orange fluff ball in her cat bed; sitting and/or sleeping next to her favorite humans; being held like a baby and having her head and ears rubbed...and rubbed...and, oh yes, let\u0027s rub them some more! Because Coco was once bullied by another cat, we recommend that her adoptive home be feline-free, with maybe a small, boundary observing dog as a four-legged friend. As for children, the older and gentler variety would be best. Finally, to that one special family reading this right now, we can say with certainty that your willingness to welcome a kitty like Coco into your home will be repaid many times over in warm and loving companionship All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information, or to meet Coco, please email [email protected]",

    "description": "Affectionate, laid-back, Purring Champion! Cora was quite shy when she first came to her foster home, but within 2 weeks she had blossomed into a total love bug! She\u0027ll follow you around and tell you how much she wants you to pet her. Her playful side has also emerged, and she enjoys batting balls and crinkle toys around. Cora lives with 6 other foster cats and gets along well with all of them. We haven\u0027t seen her with dogs or kids. She has excellent litter and scratching manners. Cora would do well in a quieter home, with people who will welcome her attention and shower her with the love she craves and deserves. Cora is FeLV+ (Feline Leukemia Virus), which causes a weakened immune system and requires special care. APA! provides some medical assistance after adoption. Cats with FeLV typically have a shortened lifespan. Cora is not contagious to people or dogs, but should live only with other FeLV+ cats. For more information, please contact APA! or read more by our Partner, Best Friends Animal Society: http://bestfriends.org/Resources/FAQs-About-Feline-Leukemia-Virus-FeLV All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip.

    "description": "Shy - Gentle - Sweet Dave Gruel is a very sweet boy who takes a bit to get to know you, but once you have earned his trust, he will happily let you pick him up and love on him. He\u0027s low-maintenance and doesn\u0027t require a lot of expensive toys or active playtime. All he needs is someone to gently pet him and tell him what a good boy he is. In return, he will be your most loyal and loving friend. Dave LOVES other cats! He would benefit from a cat friend who is super confident and outgoing to show him the ropes. Older children, such as teenagers, would be fine for this shy boy, but small children and dogs would probably be too scary, at least at this point.

    "description": "Misunderstood, Quiet, Rough-around-the-edges The first thing you may notice about Donkey are his ears! Which are rather beat up from his previous life. But we think they make him distinctively handsome and a bit mysterious! Donkey would love a home with other cats! He will snuggle with them, groom them, and hang out with them. He is a mellow guy and would do best with a cat with a similar personality; no sassy cats, please. Donkey\u0027s human companions should be young adults or adults - loud noises and unpredictable activity startle and scare him (and he may give an indignant hiss to let you know what he thinks, but nothing more than that), so little, active kids would be too much for him. He needs things on the quiet, routine side! His cat-experienced humans also should be able to give him gentle socialization and the TLC he so richly deserves. Donkey likes to purr! And he likes for you to pet him. Contact us today to meet Donkey! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip.

    "description": "Zany, Playful, Entertaining Let us introduce you to madcap Macadamia! Kind of weird, somewhat silly, a space cadet at times and endlessly fun! Some days Macadamia decides to run from you when you enter the room, next thing you know she\u0027s rolling over on the floor asking for belly rubs! She\u0027s always ready to emphatically chat with you about all things kitty and she\u0027s in heaven when you pet her pretty coat. If Macadamia is in full wacky-mode, she will run right into things, then it\u0027s off to play with a wand toy, she loves those! She hasn\u0027t been in a home with kids, but she\u0027d likely acclimate nicely to older, respectful children. We haven\u0027t seen her with dogs, but we suspect she\u0027d take charge and try to boss them around! Macadamia is FeLV+ (Feline Leukemia Virus), which causes a weakened immune system and requires special care. APA! provides some medical assistance after adoption. Cats with FeLV typically have a shortened lifespan. She is not contagious to people or dogs, but should live only with other FeLV+ cats. For more information, please contact APA! or read more by our Partner, Best Friends Animal Society: http://bestfriends.org/Resources/FAQs-About-Feline-Leukemia-Virus-FeLV. Macadamia has lived in kitty group rooms during her entire time at the shelter and has cohabitated with her roomies just fine. She has been known to be slightly litterbox challenged. She almost entirely urinates in the litterbox, but she leaks just a little bit, too. We don\u0027t know why, but it hasn\u0027t worsened at all over time. You might even say it\u0027s part of her quirky charm! We won\u0027t say Macadamia is nutty...that would be too easy! But, entertaining, endearing and cream of the kooky kitties? Oh yes! Contact us today to make it a date with Macadamia! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

Although she is mostly independent and shy, Stripes will open up to if you sit and chat with her for a while. When she\u0027s tucked away, she will happily come out to play if you call her name enough. Stripes is your best chatty friend who is always excited to share her feelings with you. Stripes is extremely active for an older cat, especially in the evening/night. She really loves to pounce on strings and other toys that she can chase around. She lets you know she\u0027s happy while playing by shaking the tip of her tail like a fluffy rattlesnake, punctuated with loud purrs. She also loves cat tunnels for play, to relax in, or just as her go-to place where she knows she always can be comfortable. She also likes to watch the world go by from her window perch (aka: Cat TV). Stripes\u0027 tiny body and features makes her kitten-like in appearance. She\u0027s missing a couple teeth, but that makes her look even cuter! And who wouldn\u0027t love to gaze longingly into her giant eyes? Because Stripes is more active in the evening, she would do best in a home that can give her some attention after dinner time. She should be fine in a household with other cats if they are calm and respect her space. We have yet to see her around kids and dogs. Do you have a window, a few toys, and some love to spare? Stripes is ready to return the favor with lots of purrs and love! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip.

We don\u0027t know how she feels about dogs. She may be OK with older, respectful kids, but she hisses and runs from loud, fast-moving kids. She clearly prefers adults, and is a total love bug with them. Mel\u0027s only strict personal requirement is that you provide her with Dollar Tree unscented clay litter. If you do, she\u0027ll consistently use her litter box, and if you don\u0027t, she may express her displeasure by going elsewhere. Kitties do have their quirks, and this just happens to be hers. Mel has diabetes and requires some extra medical care, including a regulated diet and insulin. For more information, please contact APA! Mel would do best in a stable, quiet home with adults who stick to a routine. She\u0027s content to be a single pet, and would probably be happiest without other pets around. If you\u0027re looking for a calm, cuddly couch potato kitty, Mel might just be perfect for you! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Mel, please email us at [email protected]",

    "description": "Free-Spirited - Affectionate - Loving Sunnie is truly a free spirit. She was rescued from a life on the streets, and still has her street smarts about her. She\u0027s very loving, and wants to be someone\u0027s lap cat. However, her time on the streets have made her a little wary, and her special humans will need to give her gentle encouragement to continue her transition to adored indoor lap-cat. She will reward you with lots of love and purrs! Sunnie loves to cuddle and play with the resident cat in her foster home, and would love to go to a home with another kitty for company. She is not, however, a fan of dogs, although she can tolerate them if they keep a respectful distance. Sunnie can be a tiny bit skittish, and for this reason, we don\u0027t recommend a home with small children, although older children would be fine. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Shy, Loving, Easy Mimi is a beautiful senior cat with mesmerizing eyes. As an older gal, she prefers to spend her days lounging around, making her ideal for an owner who works during the day. She doesn\u0027t really enjoy being picked up, however, once night rolls around, she loves to come find you to get pets and some good cuddles! You won\u0027t have to question when this affectionate girl needs petting, because she\u0027ll definitely let you know by grabbing your hand with her paw! She\u0027ll also chase cat toys and bat them around on her own now and then. But, overall she prefers napping to playing. Mimi is pretty quiet most of the time but likes chirping and purring to get attention rather than meowing. Although she is a little shy at first, it only takes her a couple of days to warm up. Once that happens, this easygoing, sweet girl absolutely loves to hop in your bed and snuggle with you at night! Her favorite thing to do is to put her little nose in front of your face while you\u0027re sleeping and purr to get your attention. She is skittish around kids and most likely would be the same with dogs. So, a home without either would be best. Mimi would do well in a tranquil household with one or more adults who will give her the time she needs to warm up and who enjoy soft, kitty snuggles. If this sounds like you, contact us to meet Mimi today! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Mimi, please email [email protected]",

    "description": "Laid-back, People-social, Cute to watch Rue MeowClanahan is a loving cat who wants to be where her people are. She has been in a few homes in her short life, so it may take a little bit of time for her to completely trust you - she has to know that you are the real deal - but it is rewarding when you see her placing a little more trust in your hands every day! She will sit next to you on the sofa (she doesn\u0027t seem to be a lap cat), doesn\u0027t mind when you pick her up and pet her, and will come running to greet you. If you are busy working at your computer, she is content to lie at your feet or take a stroll around your desk, just to keep you company. Rue is in a foster home with two young-ish children who always want to hold her, and she has no problem with them picking her up. She was nervous when she met the resident dog, but over time learned that he was a cat-friendly dog, and now can happily lounge around him. Rue MeowClanahan is FeLV+ (Feline Leukemia Virus), which causes a weakened immune system and requires special care. APA! provides some medical assistance after adoption. Cats with FeLV typically have a shortened lifespan. Rue is not contagious to people or dogs, but should live only with other FeLV+ cats. For more information, please contact APA! or read more by our Partner, Best Friends Animal Society: http://bestfriends.org/Resources/FAQs-About-Feline-Leukemia-Virus-FeLV Rue is super cute when she gets a burst of energy, playfully chasing toy balls (or wine corks!) around the house. She grabs at string toys and likes toys that roll. She uses the scratching post, too! She is young but not kitten-active, and fun to watch when she is at play. Rue seems to be quite adaptable, and would do best in a home with people around for her to socialize with! Her happy greeting when she sees you will definitely give your spirit a boost. She is a pretty kitty who is fastidious about her grooming and using her litter box. We love Rue! Contact us today to meet her - we think you will love her, too. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Relaxed, Easy-Going, Quiet In the hustle and bustle of life, sometimes you just want a mellow, uncomplicated, no-drama friend to hang out with. Wallace is that feline friend! He will cheerfully welcome your cuddling at any time, but won\u0027t follow you around to demand attention. He is content to lounge around and wait for an opening in your cuddling schedule! Wallace extends his good-natured behavior to other animals, both cats and dogs. He wants to be friends with other cats, but if he meets an unfriendly cat, he will retreat submissively and walk away in a relaxed, \"no worries!\" kind of way. Similarly, he wants to be friends with the dogs he has met, though he does prefer his canines on the quiet side; overly-active dogs that run towards him startle him. Otherwise, he easily shares space with dogs and has no problem approaching them when they are sitting or resting. What a great guy! Wallace is being treated for an non-contagious infection on his nose. He is a senior guy with a limp, though sometimes he will surprise you when he sprints and skips through the house! (No reason, just a burst of joyfulness he wanted to express.) He is friendly with kids, but since he is older, he\u0027s not the right playmate for children. He is supremely blissful when they pet him and treat him gently, though! Wallace likes to sit by a window and watch birds. He isn\u0027t interested in toys or climbing anything, but in his foster home there is a small, enclosed yard where he is allowed to go (always supervised!) - and he is excited to try and catch a bug. But that is short-lived, and then he is doing what he does best: napping and exuding complete satisfaction and fulfillment. Life is good! You might hear Wallace when it is time to eat and he discovers that his dish is empty, but that\u0027s about it. He is a low-maintenance cat that needs a quiet, low-traffic home. He enjoys peace, harmony, and a hushed environment! Having other animals with a similar personality to hang out with would suit him, too. Wallace takes \"content\" to a whole new level. Contact us today to meet this sweet boy! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

This active girl is bursting with energy; whether she\u0027s chasing down a wand toy or wrestling a stuffed animal, Dumplings gives playtime 110%. While she can be a bit sassy with other cats, Dumplings is just looking for a playmate who can keep up with her. Dumplings is an independent kitten who is happy to curl up next to you when she\u0027s worn herself out, but most of the time she prefers to keep to herself. She would probably do okay with older children, but she\u0027s a bit too rowdy for younger kids. Dumplings would do best in a loving home full of toys and plenty of space for exploring and zooming around.

Ron\u0027s full of playful energy, but when the party\u0027s over he loves to cuddle up for a nice nap. He loves people too! They\u0027re fascinating, and he\u0027s perfectly content to perch and watch you do your weird human things between play sessions. And don\u0027t worry about when it\u0027s time for pets -- Ron will definitely let you know with a sweet meow or three. Ron also got his name for his orange tabby coat, and his nickname is \"Bob\" because he\u0027s got a cute, stubby tail. If you\u0027re looking for a playful, sweet, and chatty kitty, then Ron is your guy. He\u0027d be really happy to have some feline friends to cat around with, too.

    "description": "Shy, Quiet, Autonomous Danny Boy is a guy who knows his own mind and what he likes. So he has one fundamental rule: he likes things on his own terms! He is a totally sweet guy, he just likes to stay above the fray. For example... Danny Boy is friendly and will greet you, welcoming some loving and petting! And when he is done, he will move on to something else; on his own terms. He doesn\u0027t seem to want to cuddle, but we think that might change once he is out of the shelter environment and in his own home. And Danny Boy is curious and playful, but - you guessed it! - on his own terms. He likes to play with jingly toys on his own, plus plays well with his favorite feline playmate (he basically ignores the other cats). He would probably be fine in a quiet home with another mellow cat, as long as he has his own space to retire to when he needs some alone time. Adults and older children who respect Danny Boy\u0027s space and time requirements would be the best human companions for him.

He is a pretty shy and reserved guy and his favorite thing in the world is to chill with his people and just lounge. He doesn\u0027t play too much, but will come running when he hears the treat bag! He also enjoys sitting atop his kitty castle and surveying his \"kingdom. This sweet boy has the cutest face, he may look like a grump but couldn\u0027t be further from it. His fur is a luxurious, soft gray with the most perfect white spots on his belly and his toes, with a nose to match. Ryder is a survivor and he won\u0027t let anything keep him down. He is also a calm, quiet cat who would prefer to be the only cat at home so he can get all the love and affection his people have to give... and treats, of course!

    "description": "Playful, Curious, Shy We don\u0027t mean to brag, but Porthos may be the most handsome of the Musketeers bunch. He has a natural white mustache and beard and that orange coat of his is extra soft! His ears are a bit rugged, but everyone has their flaws. Besides, it adds to his character. Even though Porthos is noble, he is not at all proud. A tough beginning in the wild has made him a bit leery and shy. But, when you pet him he thinks it feels nice and if you give him the time he needs, he will show you his true affections. He would love a human companion who knows his kind and who will be patient while he learns what it means to be a domesticated lad. Playing is his specialty and feathers, bells and anything with catnip suits his fancy! If your tub isn\u0027t full of water, he may bring a toy in and get a little game of handball going. Those little foam soccer balls would be lots of fun if you\u0027d like to sponsor one of his sports! He likes other cats, rabbits, and friendly dogs; the non-hyper ones please. He has found the scratching post quite useful and he always use the litter box. If you\u0027re looking for a dashing kitty with a soft side just waiting to be revealed, contact us to meet Porthos today!

He adores snuggle time with sweet nuzzles into your neck and rubbing against you. You even have a personal hair stylist since Easter likes to groom your hair! Since he is a kitten, he loves to play with his foster mates, Kibble, Katnip and Kaleidoscope, and especially with string toys. He also loves to romp around on his cat tree. He is a pretty quiet kitty, but he is increasingly becoming more vocal to let you know when your attention is needed. He\u0027ll even be proactive with his dainty paw and reach out to you or climb up and search for the perfect spot in your lap. If you happen to have a phone or laptop there, he\u0027ll be glad to \"help\" you make use of it! Easter\u0027s ideal home would be with one of his foster mates or another playful kitty to keep him company. Two is better than one!

    "description": "Playful - Energetic - Cuddly Ashley is a beautiful and extremely soft white kitten with gorgeous green eyes and a few strategically-placed splotches: a tiny black one on her nose and a charcoal gray one right on top of her head between her ears. Fortunately, she enjoys snuggling and sleeping next to her humans, so you\u0027ll be able to pet her soft coat often. While Ashley likes to cuddle, she loves to play - she can often be found running around and exploring her foster home. Ashley\u0027s favorite toys include feathers, squeaky toys, and the ever-popular laser pointer. But she doesn\u0027t want to only play by herself - she likes to have interactive play time with her favorite humans. Ashley isn\u0027t a particularly chatty cat, but she has an adorable chirp of a meow. And she definitely has a good purring engine. A kitten as sweet and well-rounded as Ashley would do well in almost any loving home, but the best-case scenario for her would involve plenty of room to explore and humans who can play and provide affection. She would likely enjoy being part of a house with cat-savvy kids who can keep up with her! Ashley has tested positive for Feline Leukemia (FeLV). It is possible for kittens six months and younger to shed this virus completely and test negative, so Ashley will be re-tested for FeLV at her six month birthday, at which time a definitive diagnosis can be assured. Until then, Ashley should live with no other cats or kittens to ensure the virus is not passed. Ashley is available for adoption now to adopters who can accommodate a feline leukemia positive, or negative, cat as she is not yet of age to have a definitive test. For more information, please contact APA! or read more by our Partner, Best Friends Animal Society: http://bestfriends.org/Resources/FAQs-About-Feline-Leukemia-Virus-FeLV All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip.

If you\u0027re willing to put in the time and effort with ample patience, you\u0027re bound to fall in love. Smelly Cat also loves her foster sister, Stinka. They were both found as feral kittens, so they understand each other. And, even more good news: Smelly Cat is still young! There\u0027s plenty of time to teach her to trust and love a family. She\u0027s also pretty darn cute with that tabby splotch on her head. Smelly Cat would probably do best in a home with adults and older kids. She barely understands grown-ups, so kids would probably be pretty overwhelming. Ideally she\u0027d be the true queen of the castle, but she might do okay with other cats, maybe not so much dogs.

He sees that something is going on in there, and he wants to be a part of it, so he will launch himself at the screen! Super cute. Minotaur is a lover boy, too! He is happy to take a nap on your chest and to cuddle with you at night. He loves people and plays well with everyone. If you aren\u0027t around, he will cuddle sweetly with one of his sisters or engage in fun playtime - they are great together. His ideal home would definitely include a feline buddy. Minotaur is a food stealer! So far in his foster home, he has stolen his foster mom\u0027s hummus, pita chips, popcorn, cheese, soup (that was a tough one!), veggie burger, fruit, lettuce (who steals lettuce??), and pastries.

    "description": "Playful, loving, rambunctious There are two words you seldom, if ever, expect to see in the same cat adoption biography. Those words are \"cuddler\" and \"aggressive.\" But according to the foster home currently enjoying the company of a striking gray tabby named Garrus (you heard right, Garrus) those words describe him perfectly. He is an aggressive cuddler. As soon as his foster enters the room, he is all over her, insinuating himself into an extended cuddle. He has also been known to lull his foster to sleep at night, then lick her nose wide awake in the morning hoping for more of the same. Garrus isn\u0027t a particularly hyper feline as these things go, until suddenly, for no apparent reason, he\u0027ll embark on a joyous spree, sprinting around the apartment, attacking innocent toys (mostly teaser and kicking toys), generally wearing himself out, and finally heading to the nearest sunny window for a nap. Curiously, for such a active and playful critter, Garrus isn\u0027t particularly vocal, producing tentative little meows when he\u0027s after food or love. Probably both. Garrus is suspicious of his foster\u0027s dog, but also curious. It\u0027s almost as if they\u0027d like to play together, but aren\u0027t quite sure how to go about it. Because he\u0027s so receptive to attention, he would probably do pretty well with kids. Cats, on the other hand, would need to be the type who enjoy being pounced upon. Lately, Garrus has been scratching his foster\u0027s rug, so getting him used to a scratching post has risen a bit higher on her list of things to do. Along with finding him the ideal forever home: one with a big window for sunning himself, plenty of room for running around, plenty of toys to play with, and, of course, plenty of love. Especially the aggressively cuddly kind. Garrus has tested positive for Feline Leukemia (FeLV). It is possible for kittens six months and older to shed this virus completely and test negative, so Garrus will be re-tested for FeLV at his six-month birthday, at which time a definitive diagnosis can be assured. Until then, Garrus should live with no other cats or kittens to ensure the virus in not passed. Garrus is available for adoption now to adopters who can accommodate a feline leukemia positive, or negative, cat as he is not yet of age to have a definitive test.

Point is, this girl loves to be with people. Don\u0027t let her chill-side fool you though, she also loves to PLAY!

    "description": "Scrappy, Sweet, Good-Hearted Walter was a formidable fighter in his heyday...he has numerous battle scars and a ragtag ear to prove it. But, now he\u0027s more into head rubs, than rumbles, and he\u0027ll take a sunshiny window for napping over a street fight any day. Walter is shy with new humans and you may even see a bit of bravado when you first meet him. Underneath it all is a gentle, sweetheart who wants reassurance that it\u0027s okay to trust. Once he does, Walter enjoys being petted and will appreciatively purr to let you know how good your kind attention makes him feel. He enjoys chasing feather toys from time to time, but, overall he prefers lounging to being active. Walter recently had his teeth removed to resolve his stomatitis, which is an inflammation of the mouth. He\u0027s been a bit of a grouch as he adjusts, but we know for sure there\u0027s a docile cat lurking inside. In fact, he was a lap cat and a major cuddler before he was surrendered and we\u0027re told he was a big fan of tummy rubs too. We would love to see that happy cat emerge again! Walter would do best in a home with a patient, loving person who will give him the time he needs to feel comfortable and safe.

    "description": "Loving, Chill, Kindhearted Monte is a handsome, butterscotch-colored fella, ready for a career switch from cool tomboy to affectionate housecat! This big ol\u0027 lovebug is so laidback and adores when you rub the back of his neck. Monte\u0027s proportions are adorably different. His head is a bit oversized and has a slight tilt due to an ear infection that has since healed. We find his askew noggin endearing, kind of like that favorite stuffed animal you always kept near you as a kid. Head to the side, shape a little different...those were the very features that made you want to hold your special love that much closer. Monte\u0027s balance is thrown off a little now and then. But, it doesn\u0027t stop him from meandering around and has no effect on his healthy appetite! Monte is very personable and would likely get along well with loving children. His relaxed temperament makes him well suited for most any home. If you\u0027re looking for an affectionate cat who is mellow and sweet, Monte is up for the job! Come by for an interview and a one-on-one petting with this highly qualified kitty today! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip.

He is very active and runs and jumps and plays with his siblings every day. Orion absolutely loves to play with crinkle balls and catnip toys.

Though a single-cat household would be good for Orion, he adores playing with his siblings, so a two-cat family would be even better! Orion has tested positive for Feline Leukemia (FeLV). It is possible for kittens six months and younger to shed this virus completely and test negative, so he will be re-tested for FeLV at his six month birthday, at which time a definitive diagnosis can be assured. Until then, he should live with no other cats or kittens to ensure the virus is not passed. Orion is available for adoption now to adopters who can accommodate a feline leukemia positive, or negative, cat as he is not yet of age to have a definitive test.

    "description": "Quirky, Playful, Cat-tastic Red is the real deal. The casual cat lover may find her temperament baffling. But, a kitty aficionado will recognize and appreciate the magic this alluring beauty has to offer. If you understand and embrace the qualities that distinguish felines from canines, and from mere humans, please read on! Red was surrendered when she didn\u0027t get along with her adopter\u0027s dog. Her odyssey then took her to a foster home with kittens and an adult cat that she found intolerable. Now she\u0027s in a foster home where at last she feels safe and can be her persnickety, yet lovable, self. She\u0027s garnered the nickname \"Caldonia\" by her fosters after the jump blues song about madly loving a beautiful, challenging, endearing woman. So apropos! Red takes time to adjust to a new environment and winning her over takes effort and patience. But, once she settles in and is comfortable, she is an exquisite pleasure who enjoys the company of people she trusts. She gets lonely if she isn\u0027t given attention and will sometimes come to you for petting. Other times she\u0027s just not in the mood and will walk away if you try to pet her or notify you of her disdain with a polite hiss. Over time you\u0027ll get a feel for her preferences. If you respond accordingly, she\u0027ll show you her endearing, quintessential kitty love...a mixture of approval and annoyance...simply irresistible! You\u0027ll also discover a relaxed girl who enthusiastically plays, contently catnaps for hours and who serenely stares out the window in all her fluffy magnificence. She also uses a scratching post and scratch pad regularly. Red needs to be the only pet in a home with one or two cat-savvy adults only. She likes to get her way and she\u0027s not interested in compromising. But, if you understand and accept that being hissy, grumpy and growly at times and being charming, friendly and playful at others is what makes a cat, well... a cat, then my friend, Red may be just the kitty for you. If you\u0027d like to set up a meet and greet with this intricate and awesome girl, contact us today. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Red, please email [email protected]",

    "description": "Calm, quiet, low-key Eva is a beauty who is looking for a quiet home where she can lounge around and enjoy her retirement. She\u0027s very sweet and docile. She won\u0027t actively seek you out, but if you put her on the couch next to you, she\u0027ll hang out and purr while you gently brush and pet her. But if you\u0027re busy, she\u0027s quite content to be left alone. She\u0027s usually very quiet, though she will occasionally charm you with her sweet, soft meow. Eva is tolerant of other cats, but doesn\u0027t seem interested in playing or interacting with them. She really just wants to chill out in a quiet, comfortable place! So if you\u0027re looking for a sweet, low-key kitty, Eva just might be the one for you! Eva has diabetes and requires some extra medical care, which may include regulated diet and/or insulin. For more information, please contact APA! Previous to her stay with APA! Eva had been declawed. As a result of this she must remain an indoor cat. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Katnip is a social butterfly! He loves playing with all of his foster brothers and sisters, but he\u0027s happy to take intermittent cuddle breaks as needed. And once he\u0027s in your lap, he loves to have his little black and white face rubbed while purring away in your ear. The markings on his little face might make him look serious, but he\u0027s seriously a real joy! Katnip likes to talk to you when he wants attention - to be petted, stroked, picked up, played with - any of those will do for him! If you are sitting down, he will perform the aforementioned purring-in-your-ear thing and then flop down in your lap. If you are lying down, you instantly become his new favorite cat bed! While he hasn\u0027t had much experience with dogs or children, Katnip sure does love the attention from other kitties, so he would do best in a home where he can socialize. If you\u0027re looking for a cutie who loves to cuddle as much as he loves to play, Katnip is just the kitten for you!

    "description": "Kaleidoscope is all about being in on the action! She\u0027s always joining in on the fun with her foster brothers and sisters, whom she adores. You\u0027ll never lose track of her, either, since she wants to see what you\u0027re up to as well. This sweet little black cat is never far behind your feet - or shoulder, because she is a shoulder-sitter! She likes to be as close to you as possible, even touching her nose to yours. Are you sitting down? Then she wants to climb on you to play and/or snuggle. Are you standing up? She will do her best to climb something tall so she can hang out with you. Kaleidoscope is a lovey-dovey! Her cute behavior is enhanced by an adorable half-of-a-mustache mark on her little face. While she hasn\u0027t had much experience with dogs or children, she loves being around other kitties. She\u0027d probably do best in a home with a furry playmate to explore and romp around with. Contact us today to meet Kaleidoscope! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Handsome - Laid-Back - Resilient Jackalope is a laid-back fellow who loves to be petted, but is fine entertaining himself as well. He loves treats and wand toys. Jackalope would prefer to be an only cat, as he seems to enjoy the company of humans more than the company of other kitties. His ideal home would be a quiet, relaxed home with no other animals so that he can be the center of attention like the prince that he is. Jackalope is FeLV+ (Feline Leukemia Virus), which causes a weakened immune system and requires special care. APA! provides some medical assistance after adoption. Cats with FeLV typically have a shortened lifespan. Jackalope is not contagious to people or dogs, but should live only with other FeLV+ cats.

    "description": "Shy, Small, Hungry Xavier has had a rough go of it. He was hit by a car before finding his foster home so he is understandably a bit traumatized. Despite his rough past, he is making great strides in foster. He used to hide and deny affection but after only 2 weeks he is out of hiding and will even accept head pets. Xavier isn\u0027t exactly social, but he is tolerant of just about everything. He tolerates other cats and dogs as long as they don\u0027t invade his space. He isn\u0027t crazy about play time because some toys frighten him. Xavier is happiest when curled up for a cat nap or when he\u0027s eating - like most cats! That being said, his ideal home would be pretty laid-back and willing to let him do his own thing. With some patience and love, Xavier will be on his way to being an excellent house kitty.

    "description": "Playful, Funny, Loving Unlike her namesake, Cthulhu is all cat - and a very pretty girl! She is gray with white markings from her chin to her tummy, plus her paws; in fact, if she were to be named for a fictional character, \"Tom\" (from Tom \u0026 Jerry) would probably be spot-on -- she very much resembles that animated feline! Cthulhu is super playful, and she will keep you entertained! She thinks anything is a toy, so everything is fair game. For extra cuteness, she has a pounce-to-the-side-as-she-runs trademark move that is funny and adorable! When Cthulhu exits play mode, she wants to cuddle with you and be petted! She will purr her joy, happiness, and bliss. And when play mode kicks on again, she may use your hand as a chew toy. She is easy to re-direct, though - simply point her to something she can stalk, bat around, chase, and/or pounce on! Cthulhu has tested positive for Feline Leukemia (FeLV). It is possible for kittens six months and younger to shed this virus completely and test negative, so she will be re-tested for FeLV at her six month birthday, at which time a definitive diagnosis can be assured. Until then, she should live with no other cats or kittens to ensure the virus is not passed. Cthulhu is available for adoption now to adopters who can accommodate a feline leukemia positive, or negative, cat as she is not yet of age to have a definitive test. For more information, please contact APA! or read more by our Partner, Best Friends Animal Society: http://bestfriends.org/Resources/FAQs-About-Feline-Leukemia-Virus-FeLV The ideal home for Cthulhu would be with people who will love her and play with her in a home that provides many places to explore! If you are ready to meet Cthulhu, contact us today. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Cthulhu, please email [email protected]",

    "description": "Shy, sweet, lovable As fun and interesting as it might be to have a Nene (the official state bird of Hawaii, pronounced \"nay-nay\") as a pet, we\u0027re sure you\u0027d be a lot happier (and more environmentally conscious) with our little namesake. Our Nene has a beautiful black and white coat, a distinctive black splash of a nose and long white hairs sprouting randomly from her black markings. The largest of three siblings, Nene was under the weather for while, and as a result she\u0027s still quite shy and less active than she might normally be. She\u0027s been contenting herself mostly with snuggling down in her favorite spot and watching the other household cats play. From the security of her bed she started batting at a fleece string toy and soft fuzzy balls tossed her way. And lately, Nene\u0027s even begun to venture tentatively from her spot to explore and interact with her feline housemates. You get the feeling she\u0027s just waiting for her moment to shine. Perhaps it\u0027ll be a moment you\u0027d like to share with her in the quiet and loving security of your home. We certainly hope so. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Sweet, diminutive, playful It\u0027s true that GoGo isn\u0027t all that long out of her kitten stage, but she seems to be in very little hurry to kiss those halcyon days goodbye. The smallest of her litter, this black and white fluffball remains on the diminutive side, so much so that the picture of her scampering about the house on her tiny little feet is sure to become the officially accepted definition of cute. String toys, the usual feline favorite, haven\u0027t interested GoGo so far. But fuzzy-ball batting sessions, accompanied by her unique vocalizations, delight her no end. Socially, GoGo is as content to snuggle up with other cats in the house (don\u0027t know about dogs yet) as she is with its two-legged critters, young and old alike. After some initial shyness, up your leg she scampers (cute, cute, cute), politely requesting to be loved, petted, skritched, cosseted and otherwise doted upon. Satisfied by the much-deserved attention, GoGo is then free to dismount the chosen lap and resume her most important task: exploring uncharted territory around the corner, up the stairs, behind the drapes, inside the closet, under the bed. Just imagine how fascinating GoGo would find your corners, your stairs, your drapes, your closets, your bed. And, of course, you. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information, or to meet GoGo, please email [email protected]",

    "description": "Friendly, Playful, Adventurer Jojo is an inquisitive cat who loves to explore and discover new things. When she isn\u0027t finding new adventures, she craves attention from her human companions in the form of snuggles and head rubs. Jojo is one spunky girl who can find a toy in anything, but she loves a good game of swat the string. Jojo also enjoys chatting and greets her humans when they come in the door for playtime or nose boops. Jojo has the sweetest face with a cute fuzzy white belly! It\u0027s easy to see why she is the center of attention. Her activity level and desire to be around people make her one of a kind, which means she needs a household that lets her roam, play, and explore. Since she is also so vocal she fits best in households that will welcome her conversations. She hasn\u0027t been around dogs, but loves to snuggle up with her brothers and sisters after a long play session. If you\u0027re looking for a spunky, snuggly cat with a fun sense of adventure, contact us to meet your new best friend, Jojo. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Cheerful Affectionate Explorer Griffin is a cheerful and very playful girl who was evacuated from a Houston shelter before Harvey hit. It took her a couple of weeks to feel comfortable in her foster home, but once she settled in, she became very active and adventurous. She\u0027s already best buds with the foster\u0027s older cat. They play and nap together, groom each other, and share their food. Griffin loves her scratching post, cat nip, and toy balls - especially the ones that make noise. She\u0027ll play all night long, roaming and chasing imaginary prey. Griffin is more about playing than about petting, but she\u0027s comfortable being held, and she\u0027ll cuddle with you if you\u0027re lounging on the sofa watching TV. She\u0027s not super-vocal, but she does have a cute, soft little meow that she uses to remind you that it\u0027s mealtime. Griffin would do best in a home with lots of toys and a furry playmate. She will keep her family well-entertained with her antics! Griffin is FeLV+ (Feline Leukemia Virus), which causes a weakened immune system and requires special care. APA! provides some medical assistance after adoption. Cats with FeLV typically have a shortened lifespan. Griffin is not contagious to people or dogs, but should live only with other FeLV+ cats.

    "description": "Purry, Loving, Playful Meet Hydra! This orange tabby is an affectionate purrer who loves his daily cuddles in the morning and evenings. He enjoys chilling out on the couch watching TV with his human (and he may even give you a kitty \"massage\"!) when he is not getting his energy out with some playtime with feather toys, balls, ribbons, and strings. Stretching his claws and manicuring his nails on a carpet condo is right up his alley and would be a strong asset in his new home. Since he is young, he doesn\u0027t yet realize that humans aren\u0027t also toys and likes to wrestle around for fun, so he will need someone who can provide him with plenty of toys, or even a feline playmate, while he is learning what is allowed in the playing field. Because he might nibble or accidentally scratch while playing, little humans should be supervised around him. His curiosities about humans include hanging out in the bathroom wondering why we douse ourselves with water and admiring delicious odors and nuances of food, though he loves his cat meals and with a kind meow, will let you know when he is hungry. Hydra is FeLV+ (Feline Leukemia Virus), which causes a weakened immune system and requires special care. APA! provides some medical assistance after adoption.

His pretty amber eyes convey a combination of wisdom, understanding and sweet kindness. Heathcliff prefers that you don\u0027t pick him up...a little undignified for such a noble fellow. But, he is definitely people oriented and welcomes affection. Gently scratch that dapper coat of his and he will highly approve! Heathcliff is far past the active kitten phase and likes to spend most of his time lounging and enjoying the company of his humans. He\u0027s on a special diet to help keep him feeling good and staying healthy. He didn\u0027t hit it off with the cat in his previous foster home. So, ideally he\u0027d be the one and only feline in his forever household. Easy-going and kindhearted, Heathcliff would make a wonderful companion to anyone seeking a super sweet, low-energy cat. If you can envision Heathcliff as the loving kitty king of your castle, come by and meet him today! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip.

    "description": "Shy, friendly, silly Falcor, a handsome kitty with a shiny black coat and big, bright eyes, does not particularly resemble Falkor, the flying luckdragon from \"The Neverending Story,\" who is white, wise, and can, well...fly. On the other hand, our Falcor does share an important trait with Falkor-with-a-k. After some intitial shyness, he\u0027s the friendliest feline you could ever wish for. Which is ironic, because he was thought to be a stray feral from a shelter in Houston before the Hurricane Harvey. But when he was placed in a kennel, he rolled right over for a belly rub. Feral indeed! With humans he knows, his shameless solicitation of aggressive petting, belly rubbing, chin chucking and ear skritching is a wonder to behold. But if he doesn\u0027t know you, he\u0027ll hide out until you can get properly acquainted. Falcor is not what you would call a highly active cat, prefering to look out the window or explore the house during his valuable free time. And as far as his foster can tell, he\u0027s not especially toy crazy. Just plain crazy is more like it. Why? After he finishes a meal he tries to cover it up, as a person might cover their plate with a napkin. He\u0027s done it after almost every canned food meal he\u0027s eaten. A quiet home without a lot of visitors woud be ideal for Falcor. Another mellow cat and a nice, calm dog who respect boundaries, would probably be okay. Because of his natural shyness, he will very likely play hide-and-please-don\u0027t-seek for several days days as he adjusts to his new surroundings and new people. But, as his foster lovingly describes the experience, he is \"totally worth the wait.\" All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip.

    "description": "Beautiful, playful, wary Responding to the siren song of cat ownership, especially when the cat in question is actually NAMED Siren, might seem like a true harmonic convergence for a first-time cat adopter. But in the case of this beautiful, black, one-year-old, an already experienced owner might have a leg up on a newbie. You see, Siren was originally housed in the \"scared cats\" enclosure at APA! amid some concern he was \"shutting down.\" He finally arrived at his foster\u0027s home extremely wary of humans, but has warmed up considerably since. Siren\u0027s personality is definitely not that of a scamperer, who enjoys zooming from room to room before wearing himself out and cuddling up with you on the sofa. He prefers to be napping high up in the security of his cat tree. There, he is more approachable, purring his contentment and allowing himself to be petted and belly-rubbed. Siren has an air of mystery about him as well. Very tall, with huge ears, his mottled markings and undercoat remind his foster of an exotic Egyptian Mau. But for all that, he\u0027s down to earth enough to find other cats fascinating, vocalizing his curiosity as he gets to know them Siren would probably do fine with an experienced cat owner who can handle his initial distrust of humans, or possibly with someone less experienced who would patiently and lovingly welcome that challenge. Siren would require a full complement of the toys he loves to play with: feather wands, balls, mice and especially catnip. Finally, he would need what his foster refers to as a \"catified\" home, with at least one, if not two or three, inviting places for him to climb and feel secure. While \"up\" is Siren\u0027s favorite place to be, when he\u0027s \"down\" he is extremely food oriented. He manages to get into anything that\u0027s left out, even raw spinach (Yum!), and that includes stealing food from the other household cats. (Shame!) All in all, he is a very sweet cat who would thrive in a low-stress home with an owner who can instill trust and confidence while Siren learns to love people and be loved in return. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Cuddly, Relaxed, Friendly Max is a sweet senior, with the cutest little scruffy chin! This debonair gentleman wants nothing more than to spend his golden years enjoying the simple pleasures in life. Nap filled days are his main desire and if you sit down next to him, he\u0027ll immediately crawl into your lap and cozily curl up for the ultimate in snoozing comfort! Max may not be as spry as he was in his younger days, but he still will give the laser pointer a run for its money now and then. He loves drinking out of the shower faucet and will patiently wait near it until you turn it on. When Max sees you in the morning, he will give you a hearty \"hello\" meow, but you won\u0027t hear a peep out of him at night. He loves having his gorgeous coat brushed, one of the secrets to his dapper look! We haven\u0027t seen Max with kids. But, considering his loving demeanor, we think he\u0027d be very affectionate around kind children. He is very tolerant of the young cat in his foster home. Although, he may let out a warning hiss if the other kitty tries to play with him...just keeping the young-uns in line! Before his stay with APA!, Max had been declawed. As a result of this he must remain an indoor cat. Max was so distressed by the chaotic shelter environment that he quit eating and lost weight while he was there. But, his appetite is improving more and more each day now that he\u0027s in a foster home. He mostly has health issues typical of any senior kitty. He does take twice daily medication to keep his digestive system running smoothly. Time away from the shelter has helped in that area too. No doubt...comfort, relaxation and serenity are a game changer for this sweetheart! Max is ready to give an abundance of unconditional love and tender, purry moments in exchange for sunbeams, cuddles and a family of his own. If you\u0027d like to take him up on his offer, contact us to set up a meet and greet with Max today! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Max, please email [email protected]",

    "description": "Loving - Playful - Social Vault is a sweet and funny black and white kitten with cow print markings and a chubby belly. She is pretty calm for a kitten, but she definitely has a playful side. Vault prefers soft toys like cloth balls and rattles so she can carry them around in her mouth. When she\u0027s in an especially playful mood, she\u0027s been known to growl when she\u0027s got a toy in her mouth and she doesn\u0027t want to let go-maybe she\u0027s part puppy, too! When she\u0027s tired of playing, Vault loves to be snuggled. She\u0027ll nuzzle your face with her, a heart-melting habit. After a cuddle session, Vault is recharged and ready to play again! Vault was a bit hissy with the resident older cats the day she met them in her foster home, but she\u0027s gotten along with them fine since. In fact, Vault\u0027s foster mom thinks that Vault would do best in a home with a kitten friend to play with-she needs the extra stimulation and attention. Vault hasn\u0027t yet met any dogs or children. Vault is pretty quiet for the most part, though she will meow when she\u0027s hungry. She\u0027s a great mix of playful and snuggly. She has been an excellent addition to her foster home and is ready to find a permanent living situation. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Vault please email [email protected]",

    "description": "Serene, Loving, Curious If you\u0027re looking for a laid-back, creamsicle-colored delight who is always up for cuddles, Duke will do ya right! This super mellow tabby can often be found snuggling up in his cozy bed, chilling out, and taking it all in. He gets along well with all of his kitty roommates and will intently watch them play as he relaxes on the sidelines. He\u0027s very curious about toys, so it may just be a matter of time before he joins in on the fun. He takes real pleasure in a nice head scratch and is such a quiet, easy-going boy, he\u0027d do well in most any household. He is a sweet baby! Duke is one of hundreds of cats and kittens that APA! has rescued from the perils of Hurricane Harvey. Most of these kitties are up for adoption and in need of a forever home. The greatest result of a rescue is the creation of loving relationships. Share in this joy with us and adopt a cat or kitten and create your own rescue love story! Feel like adding some furry, purry Zen to your world? Duke is happy to show you the way! Contact us today to meet him.

    "description": "Curious, loving, fluffy Cap\u0027n Crunch was rescued from a flooded city during Hurricane Harvey and he is finally starting to recover from the trauma, come out of his shell, and let his personality shine! His missing, broken teeth and scars indicate he had a rough first year of his life, literally fighting to stay alive. You would never know it by his demeanor, though, because he is as sweet as can be! It took him a little while to realize that he was safe in his new foster home, but he has started exploring the entire home and he gets braver and more curious by the second. This brave little lion is learning to love people, too! When he sees a human or another cat, he seems very curious and excited, and makes the funniest little noises! He is starting to meow at people, too, because he is finally becoming more confident! He follows his foster around every morning as she gets ready for work, occasionally pawing at her feet to ask for pets. He likes to lie at her feet, and loves being scratched under his chin! Whenever he gets the chance, he\u0027ll give you some good licks to remind you how much he loves you! He\u0027s not quite ready to be picked up and cuddled, but with time, we think he\u0027ll learn the joys of lap-sitting. Occasionally, he forgets that he\u0027s in a safe, loving, home and will swat and scratch at your foot or hand if you move too quickly, so he would do best in a home without small children. He might be OK with older kids if they were taught to take it slowly around him. He\u0027s learning very quickly to tone it down with verbal cues and his foster thinks pretty soon he\u0027ll be over that fear behavior completely, but he would still prefer a calm environment. He\u0027s still learning what toys are and how to play with them, but he\u0027s getting the hang of it. He especially likes wand toys and large stuffed toys that he can grab and bunny-kick. He lives with two other cats in his foster home who love to sniff and groom him and he is totally fine with it! We haven\u0027t seen him with dogs, and he hasn\u0027t yet interacted with the kids in his foster home. Cap\u0027n is a very special cat who\u0027s been through a lot and is looking for a calm, loving home to continue showing him that life isn\u0027t scary and humans can be pretty great! Are you ready to show this little lion what life\u0027s all about? Cap\u0027n Crunch is one of hundreds of cats and kittens that APA! has rescued from the perils of Hurricane Harvey. Most of these kitties are up for adoption and in need of a forever home. The greatest result of a rescue is the creation of loving relationships.

This talkative socialite will eagerly greet you at the door, and even begin chatting before you get inside. True to her social nature, Raisin Bran is happiest and healthiest in a home where people are around most of the time. Since her rescue from Hurricane Harvey, Raisin Bran hasn\u0027t met any dogs or cats other than her own litter of kittens. However, she has met children, and she\u0027s great with them! As a gentle sweetie, Raisin Bran will choose to run to safety, rather than bite or scratch, in tough situations. Raisin Bran would rather skip cuddling so she get to playing with her toy mouse, wandering the house making comments (maybe about decor?), or making biscuits. If you want to really get her motor purring, she loves pets behind her ears! If you\u0027re ready to have a new spunky best friend, Raisin Bran is ready for you!

When he\u0027s not snuggling, Toes loves to use his scratching post and scratchy toys. Toes adores the older children in his foster home, and would love a home with kids over the age of 5 to cuddle. He loves humans very much. We do not have any information on how he is with other cats or with dogs. Toes\u0027s ideal home would be somewhat quiet and calm, with lots of love and affection.

    "description": "Chatty, Sociable, Independent Mao lost her forever home when her owner moved and couldn\u0027t take her along. She is used to being an only cat and doesn\u0027t care for another cat in her space - and will hiss to tell them so! However, she\u0027s not aggressive, so it is possible that over time she could learn to live with a mellow cat who would allow her to be the Boss of Them. It\u0027s a role she is used to, has perfected, and fits her to a t! Once Mao gets through the getting-to-know-you period, she will be super friendly! She seems never to be at a loss for words, and will talk to you about everything - in fact, she can be kind of a goofball as she flops on the floor near you for some petting, meowing (Mao-ing?) up a storm; she has some boundaries about where she likes to be petted, but they are easily learned and navigated. During downtime she becomes your snuggle buddy - and will let you pet her tummy, once she has decided that you do it correctly! We think she would be the perfect companion for someone who works from home or has a schedule that allows them to be home more often. She likes to hang out with her people! Mao is great with cardboard scratchers and will give crinkle balls and catnip toys a run for their money! Her current favorite toy is a blue fuzzy ball that she chases around the house. And watching birds from a sunny window is a great sport for her, too. Otherwise, she is content to find a safe spot to nap where she can keep an eye on everything going on. The ideal home for Mao would be quiet and orderly; she will be jumpy in a new environment for a while, but eventually she will settle in. Have patience, give her time, and she will reward you with her cuddles and companionship. She may be okay around a calm dog who completely ignores her, and prefers her humans as adults or older kids who know how to respect her boundaries, petting and playing with her appropriately. Mao isn\u0027t just an orange tabby female - which in itself is rather uncommon, since only about 20% of orange tabbies are female - she has scrumptious, Dreamsicle-like coloring and pretty facial features! We love Mao! Contact us today to meet her. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Sweet, small, independent! Greetings from this calico cutie- Birdie! Her petite build and cuddly face make her look like a forever kitten. She\u0027s never far from her human, as she follows you room to room. She\u0027s so polite, you\u0027ll hardly know she\u0027s your fuzzy little shadow. Just like a sweet song bird, Birdie also has a playful chirp when you pet her. When she\u0027s not chirping her kitty melodies, Birdie has a roaring purr. It\u0027s almost as if she has a furry little motor that won\u0027t stop! Birdie enjoys her quite time with her favorite human, but if you\u0027ve got a laser pointer- it\u0027s game on! She will jet back and forth, and chase a laser around until she passes out in your lap for a cuddle nap. Birdie can be a tad cautious at times and would do well in a quieter home. She\u0027s a bit shy around other animals, but with encouragement, warms up fast. She has quickly made friends with her current kitty roommate, now they are best buds. Wouldn\u0027t you love to wake up to the sweet chirping of this darling Birdie? She\u0027s a great way to start the day! Contact us today to meet Birdie!

    "description": "Yolanda has learned to take life in stride! She was rescued as a hungry baby with no family; she overcame that, only to come down with panleukopenia, which is a serious illness for kittens - but she overcame that, too! You might think that the look on Yolanda\u0027s face is one of a kitty who is hard to impress! On her own at a young age - didn\u0027t impress her; serious illness - didn\u0027t impress her; the minor skin fungus (aka ringworm) she is being treated for - doesn\u0027t impress her (and is certainly no big deal to this hearty survivor; she\u0027ll be over it in no time with no lasting effects). You know what WOULD impress Yolanda? Having a family to love her, shower her with affection, play with her, and keep her safe. Now you\u0027re talkin\u0027! Contact us today to impress Yolanda; if ever a kitten has \"earned\" a loving home, it is her! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Yolanda, please email [email protected]",

Taco Bob is extremely affectionate and can often be found riding around on your shoulder, laying on you, curled up on your pillow by your head, or just following you around. He\u0027s a people cat for sure! Taco Bob takes some time to warm up to other cats, but he does love his brother and they play together and keep each other company when their humans are gone. With the proper introduction, Taco Bob would probably be fine with a cat of similar age and activity level. He hasn\u0027t been around dogs before, but does enjoy his foster home\u0027s ten-year-old child. Come meet Taco Bob and give him belly rubs - you\u0027ll make a forever friend!

    "description": "Playful, energetic, friendly Say hello to Taco John! This guy has kitten energy for days-he likes to jump and run and play, play, play. His favorite toy is his brother, but he\u0027ll definitely go for a toy mouse too. When he tires out, he loves a good belly rub. Taco John gets along well with other cats-he even brought a shy kitty out of its shell and now they\u0027re best friends. He hasn\u0027t met any dogs. He can tolerate children, but he\u0027s not fond of roughness. The perfect forever home for Taco John would have lots of fun and tummy time, and ideally his brother or another kitty companion. Taco John is one of hundreds of cats and kittens that APA! has rescued from the perils of Hurricane Harvey. Most of these kitties are up for adoption and in need of a forever home. The greatest result of a rescue is the creation of loving relationships. Share in this joy with us and adopt a cat or kitten and create your own rescue love story! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Playful, Funny, Super Cute Beanie Weenie is a petite little girl with beautiful gray and brown stripes, cute white socks on her back feet, and a super-sweet little face! She\u0027s quite the little comedienne, too, and will keep you laughing with her antics. She likes to check everything out in the house - so far, in her foster home she has explored the wine rack, the top of the fridge, and a cubbyhole in the TV cabinet. And if she\u0027s not IN the TV cabinet, she likes to sit on the sofa and watch golf! Her scratching post has a hole in the platform and she will sit in there, put her arms through it and play. She finds shoelaces especially entertaining, so she\u0027ll \"help\" when you tie your shoes! Beanie Weenie can be nervous when you first meet her - but go slowly with her and she will show you how sweet she is. (Hint: Crinkle a bag of treats and she will come running.) She isn\u0027t into cuddling yet, but likes attention, Beanie Weenie is super-playful. She especially likes tennis balls and will happily chase them all over and even try to sit on them! She occasionally runs laps around the house. And if you crinkle a bag of treats, she\u0027ll come running from wherever she happens to be. After these bursts of energy, Beanie Weenie will settle down for a long nap, preferably with you! She\u0027s quite the cuddler, and likes to curl up in a blanket on your lap. She will follow you around the house, and sit next to you on the sofa. She will also weave around your legs and rub her head on you. And she doesn\u0027t mind if you pick her up - the best way to do that is to tuck her securely under your arm (like a football!); when she is done being held, she will signal to you with a quiet meow. In the morning, she\u0027ll gently wake you by curling up on your chest and purring. If you stroke her cheeks and chin, she\u0027ll purr even louder! Sometimes when you pick her up, she\u0027ll even give you a hug! Beanie Weenie doesn\u0027t seem to like the adult cats in her foster home. They\u0027re older and gave her an unfriendly greeting, so that may be the reason. She might be OK with a friendly cat her age, but we don\u0027t know. We haven\u0027t seen her with dogs or kids. Beanie Weenie does want to have her kitty-cat boundaries respected. She likes being picked up and held for a while, and she\u0027ll meow to let you know when she wants to be put down. She would probably do best with adults and older kids who understand and respect kitty body language. If this sweetness sounds perfect for you, contact us today to arrange a meet \u0026 greet. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Playful, Sweet, Dubious When Gorilla is in the room, you will definitely pay attention to him! He is handsome and fascinating, with his long black hair, tuxedo markings, crazy-long whiskers, stubby legs, and chunky paws. Walk around the house and he will follow you; wake up in the morning (or he might wake you up) and he may just be in a cuddly mood; get ready to go out and he will sit on the bathroom counter and keep you company. Now, Gorilla won\u0027t do all that from day one; he needs some time to warm up to you, figure out who you are, get used to what you are all about. Once he is convinced that you are the Real Deal, he is 100% your little buddy! Even then he will snuggle only when he feels like it; however, he will accept your kisses and hugs. He may wrap his paws around you and lick you or nibble you (that\u0027s his \"love bite\"). When it comes to playing, Gorilla is pretty active. His favorite game is to hide behind a door and stick his paws under it to capture a toy on the other side! It could be a cat toy, a shoelace, you... Also fun: he will smack a toy across the room and then chase it down. He knows how to entertain himself! Other times, you might find him simply sitting in the bathtub. (He likes to drink from the faucet, so maybe he is waiting for you to turn it on for him - maybe he would like a fountain in his new home?) When Gorilla wants something or is unsettled, he will meow to let you know. When he first comes to his new home he will be super cautious, so make sure he knows the location of his litter box and designated scratching post(s). His ideal home would have no other pets and only laid-back, adult humans. He would like a cozy space in the house just for him, because sometimes he needs some alone time. (Don\u0027t we all?) Gorilla will be the sweetest companion cat! Contact us today if he sounds like the perfect fit for your home, life, and heart. Gorilla is one of hundreds of cats and kittens that APA! has rescued from the perils of Hurricane Harvey. Most of these kitties are up for adoption and in need of a forever home. The greatest result of a rescue is the creation of loving relationships. Share in this joy with us and adopt a cat or kitten and create your own rescue love story! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Cuddly, People-seeking, Affectionate Bing is king when it comes to pouncing on moving things! Little balls, wand toys, and other cats beware - it\u0027s hard for this curious kitten to resist attacking anything that can be batted around the room or chased! Bing isn\u0027t a huge fan of being carried, but he enjoys other kinds of affection. He loves people and will often seek out a nice lap to curl up on in hopes of being stroked and petted - a guaranteed way to get him purring loudly! He isn\u0027t a very vocal kitty, but Bing knows how to get your attention by rubbing his body against your ankles and walking his feet up your leg. He knows you can\u0027t resist his charm! Bing is a handsome kitten who is the perfect blend of brown tabby from his ears to his tail and some white covering his front arms, chest, and part of his face. He hasn\u0027t been introduced to dogs or kids yet, but might do well with older kids, as long as they respect his desire to not be held or carried. The perfect forever home for Bing is one that\u0027s on the quieter side and where he\u0027ll receive lots of physical affection from his humans. He\u0027s a big cuddler, so a nice lap and a good pair of petting hands are important for this sweet guy! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Kind, nurturing, loving If your household has a hankering to adopt and nurture a special feline friend, we\u0027d like to recommend a sweet, diminutive, orange and brown calico who\u0027ll nurture you right back. Her name is Sugar and, thanks to having raised a baby boy of her own, she feels free to groom anyone else she feels is part of her family-feline or not. Put your face in proximity to hers and you\u0027ll experience the nurturingest of nuzzles. When not fraternizing with the two other cats and a dog in her foster home, Sugar will make a beeline for the nearest human lap for a little cuddling time. In fact, she\u0027s been kind and loving to pretty much everyone in the household since the day she arrived. Those willing to scritch Sugar behind her ears soon become especially beloved. And if any small children are around, you\u0027ll find her patience with their built-in learning curves a wonder to behold. Quite the talker, Sugar will happily bend your ear at all hours until you finally make a graceful exit. The next time you hear her will be the next morning, just prior to the appearance of her breakfast bowl. There aren\u0027t many homes that wouldn\u0027t benefit from adopting a kitty like Sugar-new cat owners in particular. One day you\u0027ll be just a person. Next day, you\u0027ll be a cat person. Sugar is one of hundreds of cats and kittens that APA! has rescued from the perils of Hurricane Harvey. Most of these kitties are up for adoption and in need of a forever home The greatest result of a rescue is the creation of loving relationships.

    "description": "Selectively Cuddly, Quite Curious, Smart With Syrup in charge, things run like clockwork! He is regal and firmly believes he is King of the Household. He chooses his inner court, with the chosen ones receiving his warmest affection. Actually, it\u0027s not very complicated how he chooses his favorites; if you are the first to arrive home, you are his favorite! He will follow you around and supervise your activities, making sure that anything that has to do with him is performed to high standards. That means a warm lap to cuddle in, a chest to purr on, and at bedtime, a human to sleep with. And if you haven\u0027t quite made his inner circle (yet), he will accept petting and scratching from you as you watch TV, rewarding you with his purr. So you see, Syrup is a kind ruler! And one who smartly recognizes his limitations. The dog in his foster home is blind, and is very curious about Syrup. Syrup is fine being in the same room with her, though he still keeps a safe distance; but he has figured out how to quietly and stealthily move around her to stay below her radar! He respects her, so uses his clever catness to get along. Though a bit advanced in age, Syrup still has a favorite toy: any toy on a string! He is so over toys with bells or toys that make a noise. He moves smoothly and elegantly when he jumps on the bed or runs around, his eyes alert and earnest and his ears pointy and perky. It interests him to roam the house, checking out nooks and crannies, and looking for new places to hang out - especially if they are elevated, like in a window, where he can survey his kingdom. Perhaps he would like a strategically-placed cat tree in his new home? Syrup is working to gain some weight, and has some dental issues to be resolved. He is a healthy FIV+ (Feline Immunodeficiency Virus) cat. FIV+ cats typically live long, healthy lives! For more information, please contact APA! or read this FAQ: http://bestfriends.org/Resources/FAQs-About-Feline-Immunodeficiency-Virus-FIV Syrup\u0027s ideal home would have places to explore, climb, and lounge, with people who will spoil him exceedingly. He has been around teenagers, and as long as he has peaceful places to nap and a warm lap to cuddle in, he is good-to-go! Contact us today to meet this chic and exquisite gentleman. Syrup is one of hundreds of cats and kittens that APA! has rescued from the perils of Hurricane Harvey. Most of these kitties are up for adoption and in need of a forever home. The greatest result of a rescue is the creation of loving relationships. Share in this joy with us and adopt a cat or kitten and create your own rescue love story!

Seriously, Gaston\u0027s fur feels like what you\u0027d imagine an angel\u0027s hair to feel like. Gaston came from a flooded Houston shelter so he is still kind of timid and scared, but warms up slowly but surely. He prefers to sleep in tight spaces like boxes or even suitcases! He likes to have a safe space. Sometimes he is hesitant to be held or pet, but once you start scratching his chin he melts! He adores chin rubs. Gaston\u0027s favorite toys are jingly strings and ball tracks. He can bat the ball around the track like a pro! Gaston also really enjoys the company of his \"sister\" (foster mate) Conroe. Conroe makes him feel safe and they enjoy playing together! Gaston\u0027s ideal home would be relatively chill since he is timid, but he would love someone to give him pets and chin rubs.

Though he is the largest of his siblings, he is the most docile (though they are all gentle and easy-going). Oliver is a pretty relaxed kitten! Oliver does love to play, especially with little mice toys attached to strings. Chasing them back and forth brings him (and you, just watching him) such joy! Oliver is super affectionate and a cuddler! He loves to have his belly rubbed when he stretches out on his back. He is a professional Air Kneader, too; when you love on him his paws spontaneously begin to make biscuits! Oliver is a well-behaved, good little boy; he is being treated for a MINOR case of ringworm and takes his treatments with dignity and style. (Ringworm is temporary, has no lasting effects, and is no big thang!) Sometimes Pickwick will look into your eyes and seem to smile; add his green-golden eyes and glossy black coat, and he is one handsome, sweet little dude. It would be great if Oliver could find a home with his brother, PInnocle, and sister, Pickwick! They had a rough time, having to deal with Hurricane Harvey. They can say unequivocally that feeling loved and safe is truly the best feeling ever! Oliver is one of hundreds of cats and kittens that APA! has rescued from the perils of Hurricane Harvey. Most of these kitties are up for adoption and in need of a forever home. The greatest result of a rescue is the creation of loving relationships.

    "description": "Pinnocle is called \"Shin-Ah\" by his foster mom, which means \"Person of the Moonlight\". This poetic name suits his personality! He is uneasy and nervous when meeting someone new, and wants to hide in the shadows; sudden movements startle him, too. He can\u0027t help but be a bit skittish; surviving Hurricane Harvey wasn\u0027t easy (it was, in fact, terrifying). Pinnocle does get super affectionate, though, once he gets to know you. Being petted feels sooooo good, especially a nice chin scratch! And don\u0027t let his shy demeanor fool you, he absolutely LOVES to play! He is actually a bit of a roughhouser and bounces around in a typical, kitten-like manner. He plays with toys and can entertain himself, but most of all he loves to play with his brother, Oliver, and sister, Pickwick. You might be surprised to learn that of the three, he can out-play all of them! Pinnocle is slim and athletic, with golden-green eyes and a rich black coat. He is currently being treated for a MINOR case of ringworm. It\u0027s temporary, has no lasting effects, and is no big thang! Pinnocle would love to go home with one - or better yet, both - of his siblings. Being with them makes him feel happy and safe. With them by his side, he can more easily open his heart and trust. He wants someone to love him for the rest of his life; he\u0027s in for a lifetime commitment. Pinnocle is a wonderful little cat! Pinnocle is one of hundreds of cats and kittens that APA! has rescued from the perils of Hurricane Harvey. Most of these kitties are up for adoption and in need of a forever home. The greatest result of a rescue is the creation of loving relationships. Share in this joy with us and adopt a cat or kitten and create your own rescue love story! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

When Conroe wants some affection (almost always) she\u0027ll look up at you with her big eyes and politely put her paw on you. She even lets you hold her like a baby! Conroe is also very spunky and playful. She will play with just about anything but her favorite toys are string toys and anything that dangles really. Conroe also really enjoys the company of her foster brother, Gaston. You can often find them getting into mischief together or just curled up together for a snooze, it\u0027s very sweet! Conroe\u0027s ideal home would be either with her brother to keep her busy or with a family willing to play with her and give her the attention she craves. She\u0027s sweet as can be so don\u0027t hesitate to meet her!

Playful, crazy-affectionate, big appetite (goes to his gusto for life), purrs constantly, and loves to be ON YOU ALL THE TIME if you allow it! His name is Peregrine, but he is called Todd in his foster home (from the show \"Last Man on Earth\"). He has an identical twin brother, Perry (goes by the name of Tandy, also from the same show). They do everything together and would love to be adopted together. Because what\u0027s better than one adorable black kitten? Two adorable black kittens! (Well, Peregrine/Todd is all black except for the tiniest wisp of white on his chest.) Relentlessly affectionate; curls up on your lap and purrs non-stop; loves the cat wand toy and playing with his brother; and did we mention he is fine with all the animals and kids he has met? Yep, Peregrine has it all. Peregrine/Todd is such a special boy! Contact us today to arrange a meet \u0026 greet. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Friendly, cuddly, social This little mama and her kittens came to Austin as Hurricane Harvey evacuees from Houston. They were all in bad shape but she is a fighter and made it through with the help of the APA staff and amazing fosters!! Despite this rough patch, Dandelion has always been a very sweet, affectionate cat. She totally goes with the flow. She is a beautiful girl with gorgeous ice blue eyes that will melt your heart. Dandelion was initially very vocal and who can blame her? She and her babies went through a LOT before they made it to Austin and she wanted to talk about it! Now that she has settled in she is pretty quiet. Now that she is living the good life in foster care she is mostly a couch potato, with periods of exuberance chasing of toys. She likes to be in the room where her people are and will sit on the chair with you or on an ottoman near your feet, draped over your legs. She is not as interested in sitting in a lap at this point. Dandelion would do great in any home, she is fine with other cats and tolerates dogs. Dandelion is very sweet and friendly with the older children in her foster home.

    "description": "Sweet, Snuggly, Survivor This sweet, beautiful girl has been through a LOT! Silver is from a Beaumont shelter and was picked up as Hurricane Harvey was about to strike!! She had three kittens and they were in desperate need of a safe place to get out of the storm and back in good health. Luckily, they found an amazing foster and have been living it up! Now, her kittens are weaned and Silver and is ready to settle down into her forever home. Silver is a major head-butter! She loves to press her nose into your face and just sit there for a while. She is an excellent biscuit maker and loves to cuddle and be close by her human. Silver rarely meows, but likes to chirp! She\u0027s a young and playful kitten who LOVES to carry around her ball and chase it all over the house. She\u0027ll also play with string toys and will jump up to grab them midair! She has moments of high activity and after she\u0027s worn herself out, she wants to hang out and cuddle. Silver is great with dogs!! She played well with her kittens but has otherwise not been around other cats. She has not spent any time with children but she very sweet and patient and would love any humans in her home. Silver is one of hundreds of cats and kittens that APA! has rescued from the perils of Hurricane Harvey. Most of these kitties are up for adoption and in need of a forever home.

    "description": "Steve came to Rally C Ranch as a foster for APA! with a group of 24 cats that were rescued from Wharton County. Steve\u0027s paperwork said he was \"feral and \"kind of a jerk. Well, Steve is definitely not feral and will chose neck rubs and pets even over cookies! Steve did show some of the behaviors that earned him the \"jerk label. He got overwhelmed and over stimulated and would scratch and try to bite through his kennel. He was desperate for human attention and didn\u0027t know how to get attention appropriately. In an effort to put a positive spin - he was named Steve from Steve Martin in \"The Jerk! Steve is actually not a jerk at all. He is a very loving cat who is just desperate for attention and interaction! Steve is always the first one to start talking to his fosters and loves to talk about his day with them! As Steve has settled in and the number of foster cats living at Rally C Ranch has gone down, Steve has earned more time out of his kennel to play with some of the other kitties. He helps with evening chores, loves playing with toys and the more time he gets to play and interact, the better his behavior gets. He is such a lovebug with his fosters and does great with other male cats. He hasn\u0027t been around female cats yet, but he is so great with the male cats he should be great! He still gets a little bit excited and sometimes reaches out to his humans without remembering to bring his claws in ... but he just really wants to be loved!! Steve\u0027s fosters run a horse rescue and visitors to the ranch quite often, many of whom, get to meet Steve. He prefers people who understand cat behavior and can read his signals when he is getting too excited. He also prefers people with calm, relaxed energy. He feeds off high energy people and that sometimes contributes to him getting overwhelmed. In the right family, this guy will fully shed the inaccurate shelter labels of \"feral and \"kind of a jerk and blossom into the most amazing and loving cat! Steve is one of hundreds of cats and kittens that APA! has rescued from the perils of Hurricane Harvey. Most of these kitties are up for adoption and in need of a forever home. The greatest result of a rescue is the creation of loving relationships. Share in this joy with us and adopt a cat or kitten and create your own rescue love story! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Sweet, playful, cuddly Talisa and her siblings came to us as orphaned bottle babies. And now look what a lovely young kitty girl she has turned out to be! She\u0027s very beautiful, with soft, silky, downy fur. You\u0027ll want to pet her all the time, and if you did, she would LOVE it because she is a total LOVE BUG! If you\u0027re moving around the house, she\u0027ll follow you from room to room to see what you\u0027re doing. If you are sitting or lying down, she will be on you. She will eagerly climb up to your shoulder to rub her face on yours, lick you, and nibble your ear! She loves to lie in your lap or on your chest, kneading you with her dainty little paws, gazing into your eyes, and purring herself to sleep. She even loves to be held like a baby. She\u0027s not clingy or needy, though - when you\u0027re gone or busy, she entertains herself, plays with her siblings, and naps peacefully. Talisa is tiny but fearless and outgoing. Unless she\u0027s loving on you, she\u0027s on the move, climbing and finding things to play with from bits of string to dishtowels. Anything that dangles absolutely mesmerizes her. She briefly met an exceptionally mellow dog and was fine with him. We haven\u0027t seen her with kids, but she\u0027s super friendly and not easily scared by loud noises and sudden movements, so she\u0027d probably be fine with kids. Her one little quirk is that her digestive system is only happy with Royal Canin dry food. Any other brand (and her foster has tried 20!) gives her diarrhea. Talisa and her brother Tormund are inseparable BFFs. They\u0027d love to find their forever home together! Tormund has his own bio, so check it out. Talisa is FeLV+ (Feline Leukemia Virus), which causes a weakened immune system and requires special care. APA! provides some medical assistance after adoption. Cats with FeLV typically have a shortened lifespan. Talisa is not contagious to people or dogs, but should live only with other FeLV+ cats. For more information, please contact APA! or read more by our Partner, Best Friends Animal Society: http://bestfriends.org/Resources/FAQs-About-Feline-Leukemia-Virus-FeLV All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip.

He has golden eyes, a regal, lion-like demeanor, and a big cat swagger because he knows he\u0027s so cool. Tormund is the perfect mix of playful and chill. He\u0027s a sweetheart who loves his people. He isn\u0027t annoying or insistent, but just waits near you until there is an opportunity to rub against your leg or hop onto your lap and lie there happily, purring loudly and rubbing his furry little head against your chin in thanks. He\u0027s playful, of course, and loves to climb and chase anything that dangles. He also loves to run and wrestle with other kitties, especially his sister Talisa. He does have a paper fetish, and will chew up your homework or other important papers if he doesn\u0027t have enough toys around. He\u0027ll also meow nicely to let you know when his bowl is empty. A lion needs his meat! Tormund and his sister Talisa are inseparable BFFs - they snuggle, wrestle, and play with each other all day. They\u0027d love to find their forever home together!

    "description": "Gorgeous, Sweet, Cuddly Milton is such a sweet, handsome fella! He\u0027s had a hard time of it lately due to circumstances beyond his control. He once had a home, but was taken to a vet clinic where he had to live for almost a month because his human didn\u0027t want him anymore. He was also declawed on all four of his paws. All this turmoil in Milton\u0027s life has made him nervous and the shelter environment has really put this poor guy on edge. Milton is so ready to put the past behind him and find his dream home! It would include someone who will love and care for him forever and who is big on cuddles! Milton is a very snuggly guy once he is comfortable with you and when this gray beauty is happily laying beside you, you\u0027ll wonder how anyone could have let him go. Milton not big on other cats, so a home where he is your one and only feline cuddle buddy is best. Milton is FeLV+ (Feline Leukemia Virus), which causes a weakened immune system and requires special care. APA! provides some medical assistance after adoption. Cats with FeLV typically have a shortened lifespan. Milton is not contagious to people or dogs, but should live only with other FeLV+ cats. For more information, please contact APA! or read more by our Partner, Best Friends Animal Society: http://bestfriends.org/Resources/FAQs-About-Feline-Leukemia-Virus-FeLV Due to Milton being declawed prior to his stay at APA!, he must remain an indoor cat. That\u0027s okay with him, since inside is where the best snuggles are found! Milton would love a quiet home where he could cozy up to someone and know that this time he will be a cherished family member always. If you have just the place for Milton in your home and in your heart, come by and meet him today! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Milton, please email [email protected]",

Whether he\u0027s batting around his favorite toy or snuggling up in your lap, you\u0027re bound to fall in love with him instantly. He\u0027s definitely a playful guy with a lot of energy. He loves to bop around a toy or horse around with playmates, whether they\u0027re feline, canine, or human. All that playing is exhausting, though, and when it\u0027s over, Croissant is super sweet and cuddly. He\u0027s even been known to groom the dog\u0027s head in his foster home. And his solid gray coat is perfectly soft and ready to be petted at any time. The gray coat combined with the sharp angles of his face make him uniquely handsome -- almost Egyptian looking! He loves to sleep right next to you or even on your lap if you\u0027re lucky. He\u0027ll give you kisses and purrs loud and proud during cuddle time, too. He\u0027s pretty quiet overall, and he only really meows when he\u0027s hungry, which is pretty convenient and endlessly adorable. If you\u0027re looking for a playful, affectionate, and lovable kitty, Croissant is the cat for you! He\u0027d do best in a household with people who can give him lots of affection and other pets he can play with, or else he may get bored. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

Xen would also do well with people who want to snuggle with her! She adores affection and being held, and will purr loudly to let you know how happy she is. When she wants attention she might gently paw at your foot; if that doesn\u0027t work, she might decide to climb your pants leg! Never a dull or lonely moment with Xen around!

    "description": "Curious, Spunky, Affectionate X-ray is a smart and curious little kitty. Just looking into his eyes, it\u0027s obvious there\u0027s a lot going on in his little head. He loves snuggling up close - either with his brother Xylon, his foster parents, or his foster sister. Shoulders are a frequent perch. His favorite playmate is his brother, but he has gotten along well with all of the other foster kittens who have passed through his foster home. More than anything, X-ray wants to go to a home together with his brother and best buddy, Xylon. See more of Xylon on his page: http://bit.ly/2j24NV3 For more pictures and videos of X-ray and Xylon, have a look at their foster family\u0027s Facebook page - https://www.facebook.com/AllTheKittiesFosters or Instagram account - https://www.instagram.com/allthekittiesfosters X-ray is one of hundreds of cats and kittens that APA! has rescued from the perils of Hurricane Harvey. Most of these kitties are up for adoption and in need of a forever home. The greatest result of a rescue is the creation of loving relationships.

    "description": "Playful, Shy Super Chicken is a darling little girl with a grey bonnet and a cute grey-smudged nose. She once had a home, but became a Harvey refugee and now finds herself in a shelter environment. That\u0027s all pretty scary, especially when you\u0027re still just a kitten! As a result, she\u0027s quiet, shy, and a little scared. But once she gets to know you a bit, you can pick her up and she will relax into your arms and purr. We think with some time to relax in a home, she\u0027ll turn into a very loving cat. Super Cat loves her siblings and plays well with them. We don\u0027t know if she\u0027s ever met any adult cats, dogs, or kids. You can check out more pics and videos of Super Chicken and her kitten buddies on this Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/NutterButtercat/ Super Chicken is one of hundreds of cats and kittens that APA! has rescued from the peril of Hurricane Harvey. Most of these kitties are up for adoption and in need of a forever home. That\u0027s why for the month of September, adoption fees will be waived on all APA! cats and kittens. This includes kitties of every age, in foster and at every adoption location. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip.

We have no information on how he would do with dogs, but he\u0027s such a playful, relaxed boy that it\u0027s likely he could become pals with the right cat-savvy dog.

    "description": "Busy, Playful, Attention-Seeker If there were such a thing as a kitty game show, Fennec would be the perfect host! He\u0027s handsome, he wears a tuxedo, is super talkative, and absolutely loves to bask in the spotlight of your attention! Fennec is a crazy-busy boy who would be a great playmate for other young cats and kids. He gets along very well with his enclosure mates. He\u0027s energetic but not the least bit aggressive, and he clearly loves people. He\u0027ll follow you around, carrying on a conversation. He especially enjoys \"helping people clean his enclosure\" by playing with the broom while they sweep. Right now, Fennec is usually too busy playing and chatting to cuddle a lot, but we think he\u0027ll become a lap cat as he outgrows his kitten teen years. He would fit well into almost any active family. Fennec is one of hundreds of cats and kittens that APA! has rescued from the peril of Hurricane Harvey. Most of these kitties are up for adoption and in need of a forever home. That\u0027s why for the month of October, adoption fees will be waived on all APA! cats and kittens. This includes kitties of every age, in foster and at every adoption location. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Fennec, please email us at [email protected]",

    "description": "Loving, Playful, Cuddly The drudgery of cleaning practically disappears with Lavender around! This affectionate kitty loves to be carried around while you make things spic and span. Chores just aren\u0027t as much of a grind when you have a cheery fur ball to keep you company! If you need your arm back, put Lavender down and he\u0027ll follow you around and may even \"assist\" with sweeping by happily chasing the broom! When this friendly boy isn\u0027t busy helping to make things sparkle, he is very playful and loves staying active with his kitty friends. He is especially close to Taurus and would be beyond thrilled if he and his best bud found a forever home together. Lavender would be an excellent playmate for kids and cats alike and would be a wonderful snuggling partner to any and all. Ready to play, clean and cuddle? If so, Lavender is your one-stop kitty!

    "description": "Playful - Quiet - Mischievous Sissy loves to play. This fact cannot be overstated. She isn\u0027t a crazy, whirling dervish of a kitten, but her foster mom describes her as obsessed with her toys. Sissy also absolutely loves playing with her feline foster sister. Her foster mom says that Sissy should definitely have a kitten playmate in her permanent home so someone can keep up with her. Sissy is a very cute tortie kitten with a single orange toe and ears that curve slightly toward each other. She\u0027s pretty quiet for the most part-aside from greeting you and letting you know when she\u0027s hungry, Sissy doesn\u0027t say much. She was a little bit hissy with the resident senior cats in her foster home on day one, but she adjusted quickly. She has not yet met any dogs or children. The perfect home for Sissy would include loving humans who are looking for a kitten with a spring in her step. She also needs plenty of interactive toys to keep her busy and a feline friend to get into good-natured mischief with. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Affectionate, Relaxed, Outgoing How do you end up with a name like \"The Dude\"? If you\u0027re a scrappy looking kitty with a heart of gold, it just may garner you that title. The Dude looks a little rough around the edges, but, his twinkling green eyes are lovely windows to the beautiful kitty inside. The Dude is the official greeter at his kitty condo, warmly welcoming humans and eagerly introducing them to his kitty friends inside. Sit down and this friendly guy won\u0027t stand on ceremony, instead, he\u0027ll climb into your lap and make himself right at home. The Dude is a chill kind of guy, casually strolling around, just a bit curious. But, he\u0027s mostly looking for a spot to nap and to hang out with his humans. When he feels the need to do some scratching, he moseys over to the scratching pad and gets the job done there. He\u0027s slightly underweight, but, nothing that a cozy home and good old fashioned pampering won\u0027t alleviate. His long coat is super shiny and would glisten even more with a forever friend to give him regular brushings. The Dude would be a heartwarming addition to most any home. He would likely get along well with kids and would be a laid back buddy to other cats. He\u0027s not a big fan of dogs. But, he would probably be okay with a low-key dog if given a slow introduction. If you\u0027re ready for a loving, mellow companion, The Dude will abide. Stop by his kitty condo to meet him today! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

We have nicknamed her Sprouts which yes, is not much better but hey, this cat naming thing is hard. Sprouts is a great cat for anyone that does not want to have too much work on their hands. She is not particularly snuggly and really prefers her humans to be hands off. She is simple. She wants a few toys when she is feeling playful, a full bowl when she is hungry and a good nap spot for the majority of her day. She is a cat after all and their napping skills are legendary! I have never heard anyone say they are taking a dog nap! Sprouts needs someone who likes cats but isn\u0027t looking for a snuggle-bug or super active friend. She will be a really easy companion with few needs and would probably be happiest if she was the lone pet in the home. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

He likes to be picked up and he\u0027s more than happy to sit in your lap. He enjoys having long chirpy conversations with his human friends. And his favorite toys are his Mummy stuffy, balls with bells, feather toys and, of course, other cats to play chase with. He has not met any dogs or kids, though he\u0027d likely do best with older kids-he\u0027s still learning how to play gently. Casper is a healthy FIV+ (Feline Immunodeficiency Virus) cat. FIV+ cats typically live long, healthy lives! For more information, please contact APA! or read this FAQ: http://bestfriends.org/Resources/FAQs-About-Feline-Immunodeficiency-Virus-FIV Casper is looking for a forever home with lots of love and laps, plus room to play. He\u0027ll need a good scratching post and ideally a furry friend. He\u0027s very easy-going except around loud noises, so a quiet home is preferred. Casper is one of hundreds of cats and kittens that APA! has rescued from the perils of Hurricane Harvey. Most of these kitties are up for adoption and in need of a forever home. The greatest result of a rescue is the creation of loving relationships. Share in this joy with us and adopt a cat or kitten and create your own rescue love story! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

When she wants attention, she\u0027ll smush her forehead into your hand or face or neck... whatever she can reach. And she especially loves to lay on the back of the couch with her head next to yours. She also likes to play-with tiny balls like pom poms, feather wands and other cats. Buttercup is a retired mama kitty. She\u0027s very loving and submissive around other cats. She flips onto her back and lets them clean her ears. She\u0027s also very tolerant of dogs-she\u0027ll even share a couch with them. She hasn\u0027t met any kids, but she does well with the teenage ruckus in her foster home. The perfect forever home for Buttercup would have 0-2 pets already, so Buttercup could still get plenty of undivided attention. She just wants your love (and she\u0027s not afraid to ask for it!) Will you open your heart and home to this sweet little lady? All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip.

    "description": "Energetic, Curious, Sweet Meet Tater Tot! Known as Tater to her friends, this playful tabby looks like a tiger, is a sweetheart, and is super fun! A bit shy at first, she quickly warms up and will then follow you everywhere. She loves laps, curling up beside you, and being held. She\u0027ll also do delicate figure eights around your legs and will lie at your feet for some great kitty company. Absolutely full of energy, this feisty girl is a master jumper and will run rings around your home in no time flat! She has recently learned to play fetch; toss a toy across the room and she will gallop over to it, grab it in her mouth, and bring it back to you. Seriously cute! Tater is very curious about things, too - quite the intrepid explorer. Her favorite toys include rubber bands, twisty ties - and sometimes your hair! She hasn\u0027t been around young children or other animals, but she got along well with some teenagers she recently met. Tater prefers serious biscuit-making over scratching. Watching her in action is so cute because of her unmatched \"socks\"...each paw has a different amount of fluffy white! If you leave Tater Tot behind, she will call out to you as if to say \"Hey, you forgot me!!\", but once she realizes she\u0027s fine, she quiets down. Check out the following link to see more of Tater Tot! https://www.instagram.com/65ritter/ Tater Tot is FeLV+ (Feline Leukemia Virus), which causes a weakened immune system and requires special care. APA! provides some medical assistance after adoption. Cats with FeLV typically have a shortened lifespan. Tater Tot is not contagious to people or dogs, but should live only with other FeLV+ cats.

She will watch the volunteers and even make a few playful grabs for the broom handle when she can reach it! Violet is great with kids and other kitties!

    "description": "Relaxed, Lovebug, Climber Pansy has beautiful orange and white tabby markings - which gives her face a rather serious look. But Pansy has a relaxed personality, not overly-serious at all! In fact, she is super awesome. Pansy loves attention and will follow you around because a) she loves you, and b) you\u0027re fascinating! She likes to keep up with what you are doing. She isn\u0027t shy about asking for some loving, and will reach out her paw to you for head scratching and belly rubbing. We think she will be a lap kitty once she is in her own home with her own people. Pansy is playful and active, too! Favorite toys: stuffed mice and jingle balls. She is a climber, so would probably make great use of cat condo in her new home. She gets excited when she sees you, hoping for either playtime or the aforementioned petting. Pansy is chill around other cats and is best buddies with her feline roommate! She would likely do well with gentle kids, too. To see more about Pansy and her friends, visit this Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/NutterButtercat/ Contact us today to meet Pansy! She is ready for you to cuddle with her and scratch her head. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip.

Once Sean gets tired of all that playing, he is an exceedingly good snuggler, and will cuddle up right next to you - or on you! So don\u0027t expect to go to bed without him right by your side. He is your buddy in all things! Sean is a big personality in a small package! He is the star of the show when a group of people visit his foster home -all eyes are on him. He knows how to work a room! Sean gets along great with all of his dog neighbors and loves to play with them. He is a super sweet, special, and energetic kitty that needs a family who will love on him and play with him. All he wants is your love and attention; seems like a reasonable request to us! Contact us today to meet this wonderful guy. Sean has tested positive for Feline Leukemia (FeLV). It is possible for kittens six months and younger to shed this virus completely and test negative, so he will be re-tested for FeLV at his six month birthday, at which time a definitive diagnosis can be assured. Until then, he should live with no other cats or kittens to ensure the virus is not passed. Sean is available for adoption now to adopters who can accommodate a feline leukemia positive, or negative, cat as he is not yet of age to have a definitive test. For more information, please contact APA! or read more by our Partner, Best Friends Animal Society: http://bestfriends.org/Resources/FAQs-About-Feline-Leukemia-Virus-FeLV Sean is one of hundreds of cats and kittens that APA! has rescued from the perils of Hurricane Harvey. Most of these kitties are up for adoption and in need of a forever home. The greatest result of a rescue is the creation of loving relationships. Share in this joy with us and adopt a cat or kitten and create your own rescue love story! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip.

This older man is a little timid and has been known to hiss if he is feeling unsure, but once you gain his trust all he wants is to be near you! He is not a super playful or vocal guy.

Well, that describes Joey to a T. When Joey gets food he really likes, that\u0027s when he starts to warm up to you and become a full-time cuddler. Joey would do well in a relaxed home with a furrever human who is willing to wait for him to warm up and feel secure. Joey would also love a home where he can gets lots of his favorite things-pets and treats! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip.

    "description": "Playful, Observer, Chill Olive has a bit of a bashful streak - he loves to wrestle and tumble about with his feline roommates, but he prefers to play when he thinks no one is watching him! So you might think he isn\u0027t playful, but if you peek around the corner he may surprise you with an outburst of playful energy. He loves his roommates, and defers to them, letting them be in the spotlight; Olive is an easy-going guy! He just wants to get along. Olive is a handsome brown and white tabby with soulful eyes that could melt a heart. He will purr loudly when you scratch his head. Since he is quiet and mellow and likes to watch the world go on around him (he might love a high perch and/or a cat tree in a sunny spot!), his new home should probably also be quiet; kids are probably fine, as long as they are gentle around Olive and respectful of him. To see more about Olive and his friends, visit this Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/NutterButtercat/ All of the other kitties have voted, and they agree: Olive is awesome!

    "description": "Chatty, Easy-going, Doting This gorgeous gal with the softest fur you\u0027ll ever touch is Flitterby, or \"B\" for short. She chirps like a bird and runs like a cheetah, but in reality she\u0027s a carefree \"Felvie\" (FeLV-positive feline) beauty without a tail - which she makes up with extra personality! She has a tiny face and big ears, and sometimes sleeps in a cinnamon roll shape. B likes to lounge and gaze out the window of her foster home, sunbathing the afternoon away and thinking deep thoughts, no doubt. But when she hears one of her favorite sounds, she will speed towards it: the sound of her dish being placed on the floor, the sound of the door opening, or the sound of her people calling her. In fact, sometimes when you call her name, she will get a soulful, faraway look in her eyes. B chirps in tiny meows, talking to her foster parents all day long; she has a lot to say and isn\u0027t afraid to say it! (And she sounds kind of like a sassy bird when she chirps.) She naps in the car on the way to the vet, naps on the bathtub ledge while her foster mom showers (she may lick water off the shower curtain while she\u0027s there); she basically cat naps anywhere. She is just happy to be (B!), and although she is sometimes shy to ask for it, she always welcomes head scratches, belly rubs and kisses. If you give her attention or pick her up when she\u0027s not in the mood for it, she will simply walk away. B will gladly incorporate herself in whatever you are doing so that she can be part of the fun; or, she is just as happy to play with toys and go all-out on her scratching board. She prefers wand toys and other interactive toys; toys that just sit there and do nothing - well, do nothing for her! She is usually up for playing, never too lazy for a fun romp. Flitterby is FeLV+ (Feline Leukemia Virus), which causes a weakened immune system and requires special care. APA! provides some medical assistance after adoption. Cats with FeLV typically have a shortened lifespan. She is not contagious to people or dogs, but should live only with other FeLV+ cats. For more information, please contact APA! or read more by our Partner, Best Friends Animal Society: http://bestfriends.org/Resources/FAQs-About-Feline-Leukemia-Virus-FeLV B would do best with a hooded litter box and a litter mat; even then, her enthusiastic digging can kick litter out of the box! And beware if you have a glass of water sitting out, she will probably help herself to a drink of it. She is the best of both worlds, whether it be cuddling on your chest in bed, curled up like a loaf of bread, or jumping crazy-high for her laser toy, B will no doubt make your family happy as can be! She is a perfect and lovable companion. She would do best in a home with lots of attention, playtime, and cuddletime. She is a cat who likes to belong to a family and be in the middle of it! Flitterby would love to talk to you, so come meet this chatty, easy-going, and doting girl! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Flitterby, please email [email protected]",

Despite being evacuated from Hurricane Harvey and waiting a while for a foster home, he is the sweetest kitty who loves to explore and follow you around - and MUST get cuddles even before he\u0027s fed - and immediately after! He is a total purr-monster and will purr and rub up against your legs until you pick him up for some lovin\u0027. His gorgeous green eyes and handsome black fur will charm you - and his playful and cuddly ways will make you look forward to spending time with him. Nick Jr. might take a minute to get to know another cat he is introduced to, but in no time at all he wants to play with them. He is a friendly guy, all about getting along and having fun.

    "description": "Beautiful, Shy, Sweetie Similar to the Puss in Boots animated character, Maybelline has soulful eyes that are big, round, and sad-looking at times! (She also has white legs, kind of like knee-high boots.) She can be shy at first, but give her some petting and she will purr her delight and settle into your lap. She is a quiet girl who will meep cutely at mealtime. Maybelline is young and active, playing with toys and her cat friends in her foster home. She is good with friendly cats who want to play, snuggle, groom each other, and nap together; she stays away from any unfriendly cat she encounters. She likes to climb tall things and scratch the cardboard scratcher, so put a cat tree and an inexpensive cardboard scratcher on your \"grocery\" list of things for her; also, wet food (her preference). She\u0027s working on being toilet trained, she will use it for peeing but still prefers a litterbox for number twos. She would also appreciate a couple of safe, quiet, and private hidey-holes in her new home for her to call her own! Maybelline is okay with the 4-year-old child in her foster home, letting her gently pet her. She tolerates the resident dogs as long as they don\u0027t get all up in her face - if so, she will have to hiss at them! We think she would do well in a home with other friendly, playful cats and children who know how to carefully pet and play with a shy kitten. Contact us today to meet Maybelline! She\u0027s a doll. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Affectionate, Silly, Rambunctious Apollo is a classic tabby, meaning she has a swirly pattern to her coat. With her rich chocolate color, she might make you think of a sweet cinnamon bun and when she lays on her side! Add her striking eye makeup, and Apollo is one standout of a gal. Apollo absolutely adores people! When you hold her, she will rub her head against your chin and will lean into a nice ear scratch. She likes to sit in your lap, but she is still a kitten with kitten energy to burn off, so her visits to your lap might be short. Sometimes she will meow to get your attention; and when she has it, then she will meow and chirp her affection for you. Apollo plays with toys either with people or by herself. She keeps herself entertained by chasing balls around the house and attacking the scratching post. And she will keep YOU entertained by her \"stalk face\"; when she is stalking something, she will bunch up her face, get very low to the ground, and her eyes seem to grow impossibly large! She will play with the laser toy, but it seems to confuse her; where is it? where did it go? She can play roughly and is learning that hands and legs aren\u0027t toys; she doesn\u0027t mean anything by it and isn\u0027t trying to cause harm -- she is just excited, but children should be supervised around her. Apollo likes other cats, but can be a bit of a bully to them when she plays. Her ideal home would be with a patient, cat-experienced person who can work with her to teach her to play gently; and if there is a resident cat, be able to appropriately introduce them and monitor their interaction. Same goes for going to a home with a dog; she hasn\u0027t shown a fear of dogs, but would need to learn to live with a patient canine. Apollo would do best with lots of love and attention from her human companions. If you are a pet owner who loves to talk about the silly things their cat does, Apollo will give you lots of material! She is sweet and a bit of a handful. She definitely needs access to scratching posts and toys to expend her energy -- and people who will give her love and attention. Contact us today to arrange a meet \u0026 greet with Apollo! Apollo is one of hundreds of cats and kittens that APA! has rescued from the perils of Hurricane Harvey. Most of these kitties are up for adoption and in need of a forever home. The greatest result of a rescue is the creation of loving relationships. Share in this joy with us and adopt a cat or kitten and create your own rescue love story! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Apollo, please email [email protected]",

    "description": "Super Affectionate, Super Sweet, Super! Omega is a dainty lady cat who wants to be loved! She is prim and proper, immaculately clean, and always welcomes attention and petting. In fact, she will belly flop in a decidedly non-dainty way, just to make sure you get the point that she wants her tummy rubbed. When she stands up she will head butt you, then do her trademark belly flop again. She will probably be a lap cat once she is in her new home; until then, she belly flops and head butts for attention! With her ticked tabby coat (almost like the individual hairs are striped with alternating light and dark bands), you might think Omega has Abyssinian-type markings; either way, her coat is beautiful, soft, and velvety. She has a loud purr motor and a quiet chirp. She is active and seems interested in playing with toys, but not as much as getting affection from you (cue the belly flop). She is sweet and chill and would likely do well around gentle kids and other easy-going cats. To see more about Omega and her friends, visit this Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/NutterButtercat/ Omega is looking for, wants, and deserves a loving home with loving people! Contact us today to meet this super-duper kitty companion. She is a sweet baby! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Omega, please email [email protected]",

    "description": "Loving, energetic, curious There are many fine Crabtrees we could name: Crabtree and Evelyn soap, for example. And Miss Crabtree, the winsome schoolteacher from the old-timey our Gang Comedies. But the tuxedoed little foster kitty you see here has got to be our very favorite Crabtree. The reasons aren\u0027t hard to spot. An accomplished cuddler, especially when she\u0027s worn herself out, Crabtree\u0027s formidable purr is likely to keep you wide awake while she innocently slumbers in your lap. And usually after she\u0027s head-butted your face for a while. When she\u0027s wide awake, her activity level goes from zero to crazed in no time. Her tail, which she loves to chase, has so far managed to elude her. She can turn pretty much anything that comes to her attention into a toy. And if it\u0027s a real toy, even better! Her current favorite is a toy mouse that she can kick, bite, swat, stalk and hunt to her heart\u0027s content. Oh, and by the by, Crabtree also loves to watch TV! How cute and couch-potato-y is that is that? Crabtree does very well around other kitties, and is equally ready for both a wrestle or a nestle, depending on the circumstances and energy levels. Dogs and kids are still an unknown, but a playmate is a playmate, so we certainly wouldn\u0027t count her out. Invite Crabtree into your family and we guarantee her chirpy little meow will charm you right out of your socks. As will her eager, loving greeting when she comes into the room, overjoyed to find you there. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information, or to meet Crabtree, please email [email protected]",

    "description": "Cuddly, curious, clingy Leslie lives for your love! She\u0027s just so interested in everything you do that she always wants to be near you. If you\u0027re standing, she\u0027ll rub around your ankles and purr to ask for pets. If you\u0027re sitting at your desk, she\u0027ll lie at your feet or sit on your desk next to you, perhaps gently nudging your hand with her head. And if you\u0027re lounging on the couch or in bed, she\u0027ll purr her delight non-stop as she snuggles next to you. Love isn\u0027t a one-way street with this girl. One of the most amazing things about Leslie is that she can tell if you\u0027re sad or stressed, and if you are, she\u0027ll be right there with you to purr and cuddle your sadness away! She loves you so much that sometimes she\u0027ll gently take your finger or hand in her mouth as if she\u0027s literally trying to taste you! But don\u0027t worry - she never clamps down hard enough to hurt. Leslie enjoys gazing out the window and strolling around her home to explore her surroundings and find sweet napping and hiding spots. She rarely runs or leaps around, and she isn\u0027t really interested in toys. They\u0027re nowhere near as interesting as you are! She is pretty chatty, and will let you know if she\u0027s hungry or in need of snuggles. Leslie does have some dental problems, so she can only eat wet food. She needs to take some daily medicine, which she doesn\u0027t really like. She\u0027ll probably need to have some or all of her teeth removed in the future, and then she won\u0027t have to take that icky stuff anymore. Leslie\u0027s foster says that Leslie reminds her of Toothless from the movie How to Train Your Dragon! Leslie\u0027s ideal home would be one where someone is there most of the time to give her all the love and attention she craves. In return, she\u0027ll shower you with love and soothe you whenever you\u0027re sad or stressed. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip.

This spunky, curious cutie is always ready for adventure and you\u0027re more than welcome to come along! Goblin is a social kitty who loves to be in the middle of the action and to stay abreast of the latest household activities. He\u0027s always interested in what you\u0027re doing and wants to make sure you\u0027re feeling happy, just like him! His coat is incredibly soft which is especially nice because he adores being held! He is ready for cuddles first thing in the morning and as soon as you get home from work. He gets so excited about snuggling that he may give you a little nibble. But, his foster is working on teaching him that mini kitty bites are not an appropriate way to express his enthusiasm. Goblin plays with zeal! He wrestles with the other kittens in his foster home, complete with sprints and chirps, and enjoys chasing the laser pointer and exploring boxes. He\u0027s turning out to be a water lover too and has been known to go wading in the tub and to plop toys down in his water bowl. Goblin has shown indifference to the dog in his foster home. He hasn\u0027t been around kids, but would likely to well around them if they showered him with love and attention. Goblin loves gobbling up yummy food and will do just about anything for a treat, including learning commands. He knows \"sit\", although sometimes it\u0027s so-o-o-o hard to stay put when there\u0027s a treat oh-so close! However, he\u0027ll wait it out if you tell him \"no paw\"...there\u0027s some impressive self-control! Goblin is FeLV+ (Feline Leukemia Virus), which causes a weakened immune system, but does not require much special care. APA! provides medical assistance related to the leukemia virus after adoption.

This lovely kitten, by any name, is playful, cuddly and sweet! Poltergeist is reserved when she first meets you. But, with encouragement and patience, her charming personality comes out and dazzles! She loves to chase toys and pounce after the laser pointer, and she\u0027ll have you laughing at her tumbling skills. When playtime is over, she wants to hangout in your arms or cuddle up beside you. She doesn\u0027t say much, other than sometimes imploring you to hold her, but her gentle purr lets you know she\u0027s a happy girl! Poltergeist enjoys an occasional wrestling match with her kitten roomies. But, she tends to shyly stay in the background watching them play or go off and explore tranquilly on her own, often discovering yet another new place to perch and watch the world go by. Poltergeist is a stickler for a fresh and tidy litterbox and is much appreciative of regular cleanings.

    "description": "Playful - Friendly - Cautious Ghoul and his siblings came all the way from North Carolina to join their APA! foster home and, so far, he\u0027s doing great. This handsome tabby boy has a sweet face and a white ascot tie (and matching socks) and has made a great impression. Ghoul is a social guy and loves to engage you for pets and cuddles. Ghoul has short spurts of energy in which he zooms around the house, then lays down next to you and start purring. Although he\u0027s young, he\u0027s relatively chill and doesn\u0027t have crazy kitten energy. Ghoul enjoys chasing strings and playing with toys; he also loves playing with his brother, Ghost. Ghoul is not a very vocal kitty and he uses his litter box well. He has only been in his foster home for two weeks, but has already started to warm up to the resident dog (who scared the daylights out of Ghoul at first). He\u0027s starting to show interest in socializing with the dog and will sometimes even share the couch with her, though he\u0027s not comfortable playing with canines yet. His foster mom thinks he would do fine in a home with a cat-friendly dog who will respect his personal space. Ghoul also likes children (he sometimes sleeps in his teenage human foster sister\u0027s bed), but he can get a bit nibbly when playing, so older, cat-savvy kids would be best. All in all, this cat is a friendly guy who would do well in almost any loving home. Ghoul is FeLV+ (Feline Leukemia Virus), which causes a weakened immune system, but does not require much special care. APA! provides medical assistance related to the leukemia virus after adoption. Cats with FeLV typically have a shortened lifespan. Ghoul is not contagious to people or dogs, but should live only with other FeLV+ cats and be inside only. For more information, please contact APA! or read more by our Partner, Best Friends Animal Society: http://bestfriends.org/Resources/FAQs-About-Feline-Leukemia-Virus-FeLV All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip.

    "description": "Adorable, Spunky, Affectionate. Wampus is a lovely loyal fellow, and will let you know how he feels with his loud purr as he follows you from room to room. When not on the prowl for some of your attention, he turns acrobatic, chasing down toy mice, balls, feathers and even his sister! But when the game is won, he contently will accept any treats that you might offer his way. Waiting for your affection and perhaps a \"Good Game, Wampus! as you high-five him, or place a gentle love-tap on his cute little pink nose. Wampus has that classically beautiful tabby coat and is very affectionate with his sister. He is quite the gentlemen too, as he is playful and respectful around children. He has not spent time around other cats or dogs, so that compatibility is still to be learned. If you want a lively little fellow, Wampus is ready to roar! Contact us today to meet this tantalizing tabby lad. Wampus has tested positive for Feline Leukemia (FeLV). It is possible for kittens six months and younger to shed this virus completely and test negative, so he will be re-tested for FeLV at his six month birthday, at which time a definitive diagnosis can be assured. Until then, Wampus should live with no other cats or kittens to ensure the virus is not passed. Wampus is available for adoption now to adopters who can accommodate a feline leukemia positive, or negative, cat as he is not yet of age to have a definitive test. For more information, please contact APA! or read more by our Partner, Best Friends Animal Society:http://bestfriends.org/Resources/FAQs-About-Feline-Leukemia-Virus-FeLV All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip.

She is very friendly, loves playing and chasing the other cats in her foster home. Even if she\u0027s not moving, she\u0027s constantly observing and learning. When it is time to play, she loves running around the house and playing with her litter-mate. If you make strange noises at her, she will open her eyes really wide and it is the cutest thing ever!! The best thing about Phoebe is when she wants to cuddle in the morning. She will let you know she is happy with a big purr. A warm snuggly cat is the BEST and requires a little extra time in the mornings as you won\u0027t want to get out of bed! Phoebe really loves her brother Porridge and would love to find a FURever home where they can stay together. Not sure about her feelings towards dogs as she has never been exposed to one but, her laid back nature would indicate she would be fine with a canine pal. She loves to snuggle and follow her human kids around. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip.

He does not need toys to keep himself entertained - his curious nature and adventurous spirit keep him occupied as he explores his home. After a big adventure, he loves being picked up and cuddled. He is not aggressive and is very tolerant of his human and feline companions. He\u0027s not a big talker but will meow if he is hungry or wants attention. He is a little shy at first, but he warms up very quickly and loves every living being he has met. He has big eyes that light up when you show him affection. Sometimes when he is playing, he will stand on his hind legs and start flailing his front legs. He has the softest paws and the most curious eyes. His ears are SO big - it is very cute. Loves chasing and playing with the other cats in his home. He also likes to cuddle with his litter-mate, Phoebe. They are really bonded and would love to find a FURever home together.

    "description": "When Zorya was a baby cat in the APA! Nursery, her ears were so large in proportion to the rest of her that her caretakers called her \"Yoda\"! Now her body has caught up with her ears - as has her spirit of adventure and cuddling ability! Zorya spends her day exploring the house! And climbing what she can (she might like a cat tree in her new home). She is bold and intrigued by Life, determined to know everything she can about it. Zorya looks forward to cuddling in your lap after exploring and playing until she is tuckered out - she will nap and purrrrr. She plays well with people and with her brother, Zoidberg, though she likes to watch the action for a bit before joining in. Zorya is super sweet! Contact us today to meet her. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Talkative, Playful, True Companion Chatter is an easy-going girl who thoroughly enjoys her independence! She is a beautiful tortoiseshell with gray and white markings, the sweetest little paws and hints of orange all over. She doesn\u0027t particularly adore being petted all the time, but she does love a good snuggle... especially at your feet, perfect for the upcoming winter months! She also enjoys a good game of bat the mouse or chase the ball, but her favorite is climbing to the highest place she can find to get a new perspective on her world. Chatter is a talker and greets her people at the start of every morning and each time they come home with an adorable \u0027mew\u0027. She will also let you know when she needs more food, water, or just to tell you she loves you. This girl knows what she wants, and wet food isn\u0027t it! She loves her crunchies, and will only eat dry food, she thinks it tastes better. This sweet girl is truly an individual with a fascinating personality, she enjoys being the only cat so she can soak up all of your attention. When she isn\u0027t playing or climbing, she just wants to hang out so she would fit perfectly into a home where she is the only pet and can curl up for good conversation or to watch the world happen on the outside. Before her stay with APA!, Chatter had been declawed. As a result of this she must remain an indoor cat. Chatter is one of hundreds of cats and kittens that APA! has rescued from the perils of Hurricane Harvey. Most of these kitties are up for adoption and in need of a forever home. The greatest result of a rescue is the creation of loving relationships. Share in this joy with us and adopt a cat or kitten and create your own rescue love story! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Sweet, mellow, loving Like one of the great Humphreys of the past--that would be Bogart--our Humphrey has taken it on the chin more than once. And gotten right back up. Not only has he been hit by a car, he has only one eye. But if you mentioned it to him--and he knew what you were saying--he wouldn\u0027t bat, well, an eye. He\u0027s that laid back and mellow. And good looking? Gotta tell ya, Humphrey\u0027s golden orange coat and classic ringed tail are positively majestic. But does he lord it over all the other cats and call them out like Movie Humphrey? Nope. They get along just fine. And dogs? He\u0027s cool with them, too. Although one might expect him to be, with a history like his, Humphrey is not at all shy or reserved. He will enthusiastically clue you in any time he wants food or even just a little attention. And once he\u0027s got your attention, be prepared for a good, long lap cuddle and petting session. You\u0027ll know when he\u0027s content by the way he sticks his tongue out while being petted. He also does a full-body shake which is both ecstatic and adorable. Any home would be fortunate to have a sweet, loving companion like Humphrey hanging around, looking cool and adding his special brand of happiness to their lives. Humphrey is FeLV+ (Feline Leukemia Virus), which causes a weakened immune system and requires special care. APA! provides some medical assistance after adoption. Cats with FeLV typically have a shortened lifespan. Humphrey is not contagious to people or dogs, but should live only with other FeLV+ cats. For more information, please contact APA! or read more by our Partner, Best Friends Animal Society: http://bestfriends.org/Resources/FAQs-About-Feline-Leukemia-Virus-FeLV. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

After recovering, she\u0027s now a friendly, playful, spunky girl ready for her forever home! Clarissa isn\u0027t necessarily a lap cat, but she loves to be next to you and will roll over to ask for belly rubs. She is moderately playful and loves your average cat toys - strings, balls, mice, etc. Clarissa is quite chatty - she will respond to you when you talk to her and ask for food and pets with her adorable little chirpy meow. Clarissa gets along amazingly with her foster home\u0027s pitbull. They took to each other very quickly and enjoy the company of each other - so she would be a great addition to a home with a dog! She hasn\u0027t been around other cats or kids, but is laid-back enough that she would probably be just fine with the proper introduction. If you\u0027re looking for a loyal companion - Clarissa is your gal. She can\u0027t wait to meet you!

    "description": "Curious - Playful - Independent Godzilla has a beautiful, sleek blue-gray coat and sparkling yellow eyes - she\u0027s one looker of a cat. She\u0027s also full of personality - Godzilla contains multitudes. She likes attention (especially chin rubs) but she\u0027s not a lap cat. She enjoys neck massages and ear scratches, but definitely does not want you to touch her back legs. She\u0027s not a cuddle bug but she likes to sleep at the foot of your bed. Basically, she enjoys some human interaction but she\u0027s not a clingy cat. Godzilla also likes to play with her foster mom, but she\u0027s also happy playing by herself. Her favorite toys include small catnip mice, squeaker mice, and feather wands. But she doesn\u0027t care at all about chasing the laser pointer. She\u0027s great about using her scratching post appropriately, but she kicks litter out of the box (her forever home should probably include a deep litter box with a cover or high walls to keep things tidy). Some days Godzilla is pretty active and plays a lot; other days, she\u0027s content to chill out in a windowsill or on the cat tree and watch the birds. She has a cute little meow and a nice purr that you\u0027ll hear when she\u0027s content. She can be a bit of a finicky eater. She likely doesn\u0027t have the patience for small children but would do fine with older children who can respect her independence. Godzilla would do best in a loving home where the humans respect her autonomy and embrace her complexity - she\u0027s a cat that requires little but can give so much in return. Godzilla is FeLV+ (Feline Leukemia Virus), which causes a weakened immune system and requires special care. APA! provides some medical assistance after adoption. Cats with FeLV typically have a shortened lifespan. Godzilla is not contagious to people or dogs, but should live only with other FeLV+ cats. For more information, please contact APA! or read more by our Partner, Best Friends Animal Society: http://bestfriends.org/Resources/FAQs-About-Feline-Leukemia-Virus-FeLV All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Godzilla please email [email protected]",

Davey Jones has tested positive for Feline Leukemia (FeLV). It is possible for kittens six months and younger to shed this virus completely and test negative, so he will be re-tested for FeLV at his six month birthday, at which time a definitive diagnosis can be assured. Until then, he should live with no other cats or kittens to ensure the virus is not passed. Davey Jones is available for adoption now to adopters who can accommodate a feline leukemia positive, or negative, cat as he is not yet of age to have a definitive test.

But, rest assured, that\u0027s all a part of her kitty allure. You may notice her shyness at first, but as she gets to know you her timid behavior will begin to fade and give way to her enchanting personality. When she happily chats with you, cozies up in your lap and when she decides she\u0027d rather take a nap right by you than sleep alone, you\u0027ll know you\u0027ve won her trust. Now you\u0027ll find her sweetness is undeniable and irresistible. As to her nonconformist, feline ways...you\u0027ll know deep in your heart you wouldn\u0027t want her any other way! Cylla\u0027s personality is quirky and fun. She\u0027s curious about her world and is full-bore adorable kitten when it comes to playing. If she had to pick her favorite toy it would be the beguiling \"ball in track\", which she likes to cleverly combine with her other activities of choice...running and jumping! Playtime also includes the older, resident cat...Cylla loves wrestling and playing with her. Cylla would be a wonderful companion to someone in a low-key home where head scratches and affection are plentiful. Give this playful girl time to get to know you and you\u0027ll be rewarded with a loving friend who will let you know you\u0027re her special person with her cheery cat-versation, gentle purrs and simply by choosing to quietly curl up by your side. If Cylla sounds like just the kitten for you, contact us to meet this captivating beauty today. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Cylla, please email [email protected]",

    "description": "Looking for a kitten that gets along with gentle children? Anne Bonny fits that description to a T! She loves the children in her foster home, especially the 4-year-old little girl; she lets her hold her, put her in a baby doll stroller and push her around (with Anne Bonny purring all the while!), and snuggles with her at every opportunity. Anne Bonny thrives on attention and prefers to be with you rather than alone. And if you just HAVE to leave the house from time-to-time, Anne Bonny would like to have another friendly cat to spend time with. Bottom line, this is not a girl who needs her alone time! Anne Bonny had an eye infection when she was rescued, which resulted in her losing her right eye. She is one-eyed and that is just fine with her - she gets along beautifully, no problem! Anne Bonny has a thing for toilet paper, so you may want to keep the bathroom door closed - unless you are okay with her completely unrolling it from the tube; such a fun game for her! She has also been known to run circles in the house chasing balloons, eventually popping them (just make sure to monitor her around balloons so that she doesn\u0027t try to ingest them). Once popped, she is ready for another! She is fun and entertaining. Anne Bonny is a happy girl, always purring and ready for affection. Her favorite spot to cuddle is in your neck. She has long-ish hair that is super soft, and when you pet her she will give you kisses. Her ideal home would have adults, children, and other cats. She is ready for a big, loving family! Contact us today to meet this loving kitten. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

She loves to rub on your legs and sit in your lap as you watch TV. Finch is still a kitten, so she\u0027s super active and busy. She loves the feather string toys and of course, the laser pointer. She also loves to play with her brother, Sparrow. They keep each other busy and tired! Finch has been around dogs, cats, and kids - she tolerates them all. She\u0027s curious, but not invasive of other animals\u0027 space. She\u0027s especially a fan of her foster\u0027s dog - she rubs up on her all the time. Finch\u0027s ideal home would be with her brother to make her feel safe and keep her company. She would also prefer for the kids to be over the age of five since she is still a little hesitant of strangers and noises. Finch would fit right into your home so hurry up and meet her!

With as little as a touch he melts and starts purring. Sparrow is a young kitty so he has kitten energy and stays pretty busy. Luckily he has his sister, Finch, to keep him company and provide entertainment! They wrestle all night and sleep all day like rockstars.

    "description": "Beautiful, Mesmerizing, Purrrrrrs Dotty is a unique and adventurous little kitten! She currently has a condition where her eyelashes are growing into her eyes, and one of her eyelids has not fully developed. This will be fixed when she is spayed, but there is a possibility she may end up being a one-eyed cat! Regardless, Dotty is always the first one out to explore! While she definitely loves being on the move, she also loves getting snuggled by her humans. The minute you pick her up, her little purr motor starts and does not stop. Dotty absolutely loves tumbling around with her three foster siblings and does not mind having the resident puggle follow her around. Beyond her wonderful personality, this sweetie also has a very luscious and velvety coat with unique patterns. She is truly an irresistible and sweet little girl. Dotty is currently being treated for a small case of ringworm, but it should be cleared up soon. We think you will go dotty over Dotty - contact us today to meet her! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Handsome - Playful - Swift Don\u0027t let that roguish look in his eye fool you -- Karbach is a total sweetheart! He may look like a rough-and-tumble cat, but when you snatch him up for a hug, he\u0027s all about the cuddles. His foster mom describes him as a total lapcat, gentle and good with adults and children. Like most young cats, Karbach loves to play! His favorite game is chasing after toys. He is great with other cats, and would love another cat for company, although he is independent enough to be happy as an only cat, too. He gets along with the dogs he has met, too! Karbach is easy-going and sweet as pie. He will make some lucky adopter very happy! Could that special someone be you? Check here to meet Karbach\u0027s siblings!

Nicknamed \"Sparkplug\" by his foster family, this bouncy boy is raring to play and love every waking moment. He\u0027s not into the rough stuff, preferring toys to wrestling, and especially loves to leap in the air on his way to adventure! He would make an excellent leading man to star in those crazy cat videos you\u0027ve always wanted to make. Celis purrs like a champ as he snuggles up to you. He\u0027s great with kids and cats and has never met a stranger; he gets along with the dogs he has met, too! The ideal home for Celis would include a kitty buddy - in particular, his brother, Idle Vine! They are soulmate-besties and would be great adopted together.

She has white socks, sleek black fur, and the cutest little nose to match.

    "description": "Social, Affectionate, Cuddly Dear Nala is a cat with one thing on her mind - whatever it is that you\u0027re doing! She loves to be around people, whether it\u0027s following them from room to room and closely observing their activities, or hanging out in their laps, or ideally, being held! Nala is so devoted, she\u0027ll even sleep on the bed with her person, just so she can be close to them. She\u0027ll soak up all the pets that you want to give her, and she\u0027s not afraid to use her quiet meow to tell you her opinion on something! She\u0027s especially chatty when she\u0027s been kept cooped up away from the action, like on the wrong side of a door. She just wants to know what you\u0027re doing! When Nala isn\u0027t hanging with her favorites, she\u0027ll be found batting around small objects and checking to make sure that they aren\u0027t toys. She\u0027s been spotted testing Legos for their toy-ability (Nala confirmed, not a toy intended for cats). She also loves a good string toy and will dart and chase it. Her favorite time for playing is in the evenings, as she sleeps through the night and while people are away during the day. When playtime is done, she\u0027ll seek out a nice lap for a rest and purr blissfully while she kneads any nearby blankets into submission. Nala is so people-oriented, her perfect home would have a decent amount of activity and people around for her to hang out with. She\u0027s great with kids and loves being petted and played with, so long as they respect that she doesn\u0027t like having her belly touched. So far she\u0027s been a bit skittish around her large foster brother dog, but would probably do alright long term with a calm canine in the house that left her alone. Nala knows that using the scratching post for scratching is good, but hasn\u0027t quite figured out that using the furniture for scratching is bad and is working on putting those two pieces together. Are you looking for a buddy to keep you company and warm your lap on these cold winter nights? If so, Nala is the cat for you! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Nala, please email [email protected]",

    "description": "Wednesday is the kitty for you if you are looking for a sweet girl who will help you get over \"hump day\" every day of your life! She wants nothing more to be petted by you, but she doesn\u0027t need to take up residence in your lap and doesn\u0027t demand 100% of your attention...she is more of a loving lurker! Wednesday is super playful, preferring toys she can chase, like a catnip mouse or a laser pointer - or any toy that seems to dart and dance around! She likes the challenge of capturing them. But as excited as she gets, she still plays gently. She does, however, object to the hair dryer...they are sworn mortal enemies... Her nickname in her foster home is \"Kesha\" - no doubt inspired by her gorgeous coat with exotic markings. Her foster mom says that she is THE BEST. Contact us today to meet this lovely lady! Wednesday is FeLV+ (Feline Leukemia Virus), which causes a weakened immune system and requires special care. APA! provides some medical assistance after adoption. Cats with FeLV typically have a shortened lifespan. She is not contagious to people or dogs, but should live only with other FeLV+ cats. For more information, please contact APA! or read more by our Partner, Best Friends Animal Society: http://bestfriends.org/Resources/FAQs-About-Feline-Leukemia-Virus-FeLV All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Wednesday, please email [email protected]",

    "description": "Sweet, Independent, Playful Silly, playful, cuddly at times...that\u0027s Ting! She does things her way and, fortunately, her way just happens to be super charming! Ting was timid when she first arrived to her foster home. But, she quickly blossomed into a fun loving girl who enjoys receiving and giving affection. She adores head and chin rubs and will sometimes openly solicit pets by climbing on you. She\u0027ll also jump on the bed at night to keep you company. Ting likes to keep displays of affection on her terms though, drawing the line at being carried or picked up, just not her thing! Ting fancies herself as being the coordinator of her petting and play schedule...she chooses when the time is right for each event. When she\u0027s ready for playing, give her a toy mice or a string toy and the chase is on! You can include the kids too, Ting enjoys playing with children of all ages as long as they understand and respect her kitty boundaries. She gets along very well with other cats. We haven\u0027t seen her around dogs. Exploring \"exotic\" locales is one of Ting\u0027s favorite pastimes. You may find her trying to contort herself into a shoe box or crawling into an empty chip bag. Sometimes she keeps it simple and finds a nice, sunny window for napping. Ting would do well in a home where she gets the attention she enjoys for petting sessions and playtime. A household with another kitty would give her a friend to play with throughout the day. But, she would also be fine as the only cat. Spend a little time with Ting and she\u0027ll quickly endear herself to you with her combination of kitty boss and childlike sweetness. Contact us to meet her today! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Ting, please email [email protected]",

    "description": "Wink\u0027s mom was a stray who was rescued during Hurricane Harvey; upon arriving at APA! she was immediately adopted. And on the day she was scheduled to be spayed, surprise! She was pregnant. Wink and her brother, Weather, were born, and then their mom adopted two motherless kittens, Apple Fritter and Allspice. Whew, what a story! But now it\u0027s time for a new chapter in the story - Wink is looking for a very special forever home. Why a special home? Because Wink is a cat for a very special adopter: she was born blind and exhibits neurological symptoms. She likely has cerebellar hypoplasia (CH) which is a non-progressive, non-contagious neurological condition that causes balance issues. CH cats were born like this and usually wobble or have a funny gait; some cats have a minor imbalance and some are very wobbly! Wink seems to be on the more-wobbly, more-shaky side of CH. Wink is still young and developing, but at this stage she requires special care during feeding, using the litter box, and keeping her clean. She is super sweet and will give you her trademark gentle purr after you feed her, napping on you or next to you. Her foster dad sings songs to her; badly, he says, though Wink doesn\u0027t mind at all! She loves for you to hold her and pet her soft fur, and will make a great lap cat - or maybe a cat that you could carry around in a baby sling! Wink may not have visual communication, but she has a songbook of meows she uses to talk to you; at last count, she had at least six different meows that all mean something different! Developing your communication with her is precious and special. Wink should live in a home with a human companion who could easily take care of her needs; she should be kept away from stairs because she can\u0027t safely navigate them. Cats adopted from APA! with CH must be kept indoors only. CH cats have the same lifespan as other cats. For more information, please visit - https://lifewithchcats.com If you are intrigued by sweet Wink, please contact us today to learn more about her. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Friendly, Loving, Sweet Handsome Sam may be getting on in years, but his gorgeous green eyes still sparkle with wonder and they have a way of winning the heart of whoever is the subject of their kind gaze. It\u0027s understandable...spend a little time with Sam and you\u0027ll quickly discover an incredibly sweet, friendly and loving boy. We\u0027re not sure about his past, and his adorably scrappy left ear certainly adds to the mystery. But, we do know he welcomes and enjoys a good brushing. His caring foster mom brushed long neglected knots out of his coat shortly after Sam came to his foster home and he absolutely loved it! A gentle touch and the simplest act of kindness are never taken for granted by this appreciative kitty. He likes to chat too, perhaps sharing tales of adventure from his younger days or maybe just letting you know he\u0027s feeling happy because you\u0027re a part of his life. We would love for Sam to spend his remaining years experiencing the joys and comfort of a forever home. If you have a warm bed, a loving heart and a soft spot for a dapper senior gentleman who is ready to adore you, contact us to meet Handsome Sam today. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Tiny, mighty, and extra cuddly! Rumi is a beautiful, elegant tortoiseshell lady who loves to be in your lap. Rumi is a little hesitant when she first meets new people, but after a day or so all she will want is to be curled up in your lap. She is not a very playful girl. At her stage in life, she\u0027s here for the pets! She loves to greet you with a few meows and she will let out a few little grunts when she is exploring and finds something that catches her interest. Rumi is a tiny, senior kitty who is very friendly and affectionate. She is a polydactyl kitty, which means she has extra toes with which to love you! Rumi is fine with our cats. Her philosophy is live and let live! Rumi would do well in a chill home with a furrever human who wants a cuddly, lap cat who also understands that Rumi is an older lady with some kidney troubles who needs a special diet.

    "description": "Playful, Cuddly, Spontaneous Toadie is a total babe. She\u0027ll insist on saying \"top of the morning! to greet you, and \"ta-ta! as you leave. She is a complete joy to watch-and goes from zero to sixty in a heartbeat. You\u0027d never even know she\u0027s recovered from a broken leg! Naps give way to leaping up cat towers and tumbling down hallways. Always keeping you on your toes, Toadie does eventually settle down once her humans have finished shuffling and moving about. An independent gal-on-the-go, Toadie relishes accompanying you to each room of your house without needing to be exactly by your side. When she does settle in for lap time, her super soft coat plus the swishes of her orange tail will keep her human happy. Toadie gets full marks in getting along with other cats, though it is unknown how she\u0027d do with pups or kids. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Playful, Friendly, Goofy If you love watching the silly antics of cats in online videos, Brenner is going to steal your heart the second you meet him! This goofy guy loves to play, play, play! He\u0027ll play with anything and anyone (although he hasn\u0027t met kids yet). He\u0027s young, so he\u0027s just learning that not everything in the house is a toy-his foster home has an abundance of toys to keep him entertained. He\u0027s been playing with a puppy in his foster home quite a lot, and when he plays with his foster mom, he sometimes uses his teeth, but he never bites down and never intends to harm. On occasion, the puppy is a bit much, even for Brenner, so Brenner\u0027s foster mom thinks he\u0027d also be great with another playful or young cat. There are times he just wants a lazy, cuddle buddy, you know? One thing is for certain, Brenner will be happiest in a home with a furry friend! His other pastimes include sleeping and occasionally singing the songs of his people around the house. Brenner is content with being held for basically as long as you want, although he isn\u0027t likely to melt into your arms. However, when Brenner wants to cuddle, he\u0027ll make himself right at home on your lap. This little guy had a rough go of it before meeting his foster mom, but thanks to her, he\u0027s thriving! He\u0027s a bit of a sniffler because he is getting over an upper respiratory infection. For his digestive health, he is on a special diet prescribed by a veterinarian; for more information, please contact APA! The ideal forever home will understand that Brenner is getting better little by little, and allow him to continue to thrive physically and emotionally! Brenner is just so happy and silly all the time! Contact us today to meet him. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Brenner, please email [email protected]",

    "description": "Yara is active and playful - it is a delight to watch her run and play! She is a speedy little gal and she plays well with her foster siblings. Yara is a sweetheart - she will perch on your shoulder and cuddle under the bed covers with you. She gets along with everyone - even the resident dog! Yara has tested positive for Feline Leukemia (FeLV). It is possible for kittens six months and younger to shed this virus completely and test negative, so she will be re-tested for FeLV at her six month birthday, at which time a definitive diagnosis can be assured. Until then, she should live with no other cats or kittens to ensure the virus is not passed. Yara is available for adoption now to adopters who can accommodate a feline leukemia positive, or negative, cat as she is not yet of age to have a definitive test. For more information, please contact APA! or read more by our Partner, Best Friends Animal Society: http://bestfriends.org/Resources/FAQs-About-Feline-Leukemia-Virus-FeLV Yara is absolutely adorable in her rich, dark coat with her lightly-colored, piercing eyes! Contact us today to meet her. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

Leatherface has tested positive for Feline Leukemia (FeLV).

    "description": "Brussel Sprouts is a complex gal. She does not appear to love shelter life and that has her a bit out of sorts. She likes to be petted but only on her head. She loves to play but can get a little too excited - and might take a swipe at your hand or try to give you a bite. She likes other cats but can be a little rough when playing. She\u0027s a little bit of a tough cookie but also very sweet - she will brush up against you for pets and will purr to show thanks. See, complex - right? We don\u0027t know anything about her history but she most likely has moved around a lot lately and may just need a quiet, calm place to chill out and be still. After some time in a forever home, she seem like the kind of cat who would chill out and relax. Maybe even could be a lap cat once she\u0027s settled! She just needs a chance and humans who understand that she needs to take some time to feel safe. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip.

    "description": "Loving, sweet, mature! Catneff is quite the lady! This beautiful, light tabby with brilliant green eyes is here for your love! Catneff loves pets and will even stand up on her hind legs to get closer to your hand when you are coming in for head scratches. She sleeps above her foster mommy\u0027s head on the pillow without waking her up! What a cat! Catneff is a little playful, occasionally playing by herself, but her activity level is pretty low. She\u0027d much rather have cuddles and pets! She has a lovely, quiet meow that she uses in the morning and evening to politely ask for some food, please and thank you. Catneff is doing well in her foster home. She was right at home as soon as she got there. She is clearly flexible with her living arrangements. She does not have any other critters around her at the moment, but this easy going kitty is up for anything as long as love is involved. Catneff would do well in a home where she can get all of the loving she desires! Catneff is FeLV+ (Feline Leukemia Virus), which causes a weakened immune system and requires special care. APA! provides some medical assistance after adoption. Cats with FeLV typically have a shortened lifespan. Catneff is not contagious to people or dogs, but should live only with other FeLV+ cats. For more information, please contact APA! or read more by our Partner, Best Friends Animal Society: http://bestfriends.org/Resources/FAQs-About-Feline-Leukemia-Virus-FeLV All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip.

    "description": "You\u0027ll have to wait for Lauralei to tire herself out before cuddling - she likes to be on the move! She is happy climbing the cat tree, wrestling with her brother, Linguinni, stalking all the toys, and playing to the point of exhaustion. Then she will seek you out for a good snuggle on the sofa! Lauralei and her brother, Linguinni, grew up in the APA! Nursery, where they got extra babying from all of the caretakers. But once they moved into their foster home, they learned to hone their \"catting\" skills, explore to their heart\u0027s content, and become champion cuddlers! Lauralei is beautiful and chubby and fun! She would do best in a home with a feline buddy. Contact us today to meet her. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Lauralei, please email [email protected]",

    "description": "Linguinni is totally in touch with his Sweet Inner Baby! He has a shy side, so give him some time to get to know you; and when he tells you he loves you, he really really means it - with a sincere purr and a trusting headbutt, he will burrow his face into the crook of your elbow. And then you will know it\u0027s true love, for keeps. Linguinni and his sister, Lauralei, were itty-bitty-kitties in the APA! Nursery, where they received extra babying from all of the caretakers. Once in their foster home they learned to hone their \"catting\" skills, explore to their heart\u0027s content, and become champion cuddlers! Linguinni is a cat\u0027s cat, and would do best adopted with Lauralei or one of his foster sisters. Linguinni is a great companion cat and likes to hang out with you while you listen to your favorite podcast; he doesn\u0027t even mind which podcast you choose - he just likes to be with you! He also loves toys, playing, exploring, and long walks on the beach...well, it\u0027s all true except for the beach part. He could be your new kitty boyfriend, however! Contact us today to meet him. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

She is outgoing and friendly, great with the all of the people - including little humans - and cats she has met. She loves to be the center of attention - she is, perhaps, a little bit of a diva!

    "description": "Jill is a playful and sassy lady! She loves being out of her enclosure and is very playful; however, she has been known to take a swipe or a bite when playing. Nothing too aggressive and most likely the result of being in the shelter, but since she gives rather strong love-bites, she is not the right companion for little kids or inexperienced cat owners. She has moved around a lot in the last month and that would make anyone a little snippy, right? Jill is a beautiful tabby with very distinct markings and big, soulful eyes. She needs a FURever home where she can relax, unwind, and feel safe. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip.

    "description": "Adventurous, Playful, Funny The great candy debate: black licorice or red licorice? Well, with our Licorice you will choose black 100% of the time! She is always excited and purry to see you and can\u0027t wait for 1) a tummy scratch, and 2) for you to pick up a toy, signaling playtime. She loves for you to pet her (see item 1), but will quickly give it up to play (see item 2). Licorice is curious and athletic, expertly playing with her mouse toys and string toys (or even your scarf!). She is funny and entertaining - toss a toy and she will demonstrate her incredible catching skill. And once she catches it, she will likely keep tossing it into the air to herself - and keep catching it, all around the house! However, play will immediately cease if she hears an intriguing noise, and then she is off to explore the location and source of the sound. Along the way, she will give every object a good sniff to determine if it is play-worthy. She is interested in everything and is a great playmate for kids! Licorice is curious about the resident dogs in her foster home; but since they are TOO curious about her, for her own safety her foster family keeps them separate from her. We suspect she would be fine with gentle, cat-friendly dogs. Licorice would make a wonderful family cat! She is delighted to have people around and happy to explore and play on her own; she knows how to make her own fun without getting into (much) trouble. She is quick to warm up to people and other pets. In no time at all, you won\u0027t remember your home life before this svelte kitty with the beautiful green eyes and lively personality became a member of your family. Contact us today to meet Licorice! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "While Ugo is the smallest of his brothers he has a large personality. He is intelligent and full of spirit. While he can hang with his rougher brothers, he is also happy to snuggle and play more gently with his sisters Ululani and Udele. Ugo is happy snuggling in a lap, climbing over his siblings or playing around with whatever toy he can get his paws on. Ugo would do best if adopted with one of his litter mates but would be good with other animals as well. He is relaxed and friendly with everyone he meets. Come meet this gentle, friendly lad today! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "For you Harry Potter fans, Umbridge\u0027s name may remind you of Dolores Umbridge, but know that he\u0027s more like Cedric Diggory; a natural leader with a passion for living life to its fullest. Umbridge is ready to take on the world! Umbridge is a fan of exploring, climbing, jumping, and taking on any challenge; be ready for him to find a perch so he can survey everything that is going on around him. He loves to play King of the Mountain with his siblings and is not above using his bigger size as an advantage to claim victory! Umbridge will also happily hang out while sitting on your shoulder or playing in your hair - if you let him! The closer he can be to give you snuggles, the better. At first glance, Umbridge may look like a totally black kitten - but he has some interesting coloring emerging as he grows, almost like a black tabby with varying shades of black. So handsome! Umbridge loves other cats, and would do best in a house with active cats. It would be even more perfect for him or to be adopted with one of his siblings. He also does well with adults and little humans! Contact us today to meet this fascinating, fun boy! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Umbridge, please email [email protected]",

    "description": "Long-legs Lola, as she is known in her foster home, came to APA! with her two kittens, Versace and Voluminous. Maybe it comes from being a mom, but Lola makes the widest range of sweet little sounds her foster family has ever heard! Her favorites are trilly mrrrrrs, and she has long conversations with herself as she makes her rounds through the house. Lola is sleek and long. She has fabulous markings on her legs and big expressive eyes that hint at her curious nature. She\u0027s affectionate with people, but would be perfectly happy as an only cat. She would probably also be fine with another cat in the house with a proper, slow introduction. She hasn\u0027t met any dogs, but seems afraid of them at a distance. Lola has a temporary bit of ringworm, but a lifetime of love to give. Ringworm is a common, easily treatable skin condition! For more pictures and videos of Lola and her kittens, have a look at her foster family\u0027s Facebook page - https://www.facebook.com/AllTheKittiesFosters or Instagram account - https://www.instagram.com/allthekittiesfosters All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip.

    "description": "Versace came to APA! with his brother, Voluminous, and his mom, Lola, and more than anything he would love to go to a new home with one or both of them. Versace is a sweet, snuggly little guy and a little more laid back than his brother. The pair are perfect sparring partners and keep each other entertained for hours. Versace does have a little dramatic side and lets everyone know when his brother is playing a little too rough. Versace has his mom\u0027s long legs and will likely have her beautiful sleek black coat. He also has a little white locket on his chest. His fur looks a little thin at the moment because Versace has a temporary bit of ringworm, but a lifetime of love to give. Ringworm is a common, easily treatable skin condition!

    "description": "Serene, Cheerful, Terrific Hercules has little in common with his Greek namesake. He\u0027s not about showing off his muscles or flaunting his good looks. Although he certainly could...just look at those gorgeous orange tabby stripes and that handsome face of his! He\u0027d rather just chill out and enjoy a nice head scratch. This calm boy has such a happy demeanor. He may be slightly reserved initially, but he warms up quickly to your kindness and then becomes relaxed and ready for your love. He\u0027s fine with being picked up and does well with kiddos. Hercules has diabetes and requires some extra medical care, which may include regulated diet and/or insulin. For more information, please contact APA! He is a healthy FIV+ (Feline Immunodeficiency Virus) cat. FIV+ cats typically live long, healthy lives! For more information, please contact APA! or read this FAQ: http://bestfriends.org/Resources/FAQs-About-Feline-Immunodeficiency-Virus-FIV Hercules may not be a Greek god, but he\u0027s an all-around good guy which makes him every bit as mighty. He\u0027s waiting for his turn at love and we hope he finds it soon. If you could be just the one to give it to him, come by and meet this lovely kitty with the sweetest heart today! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Loving, friendly, calm! Eleven has mind control powers, but instead of tossing you across the room, she will get you to fall in love with her on the spot! This green-eyed beauty has long and luxurious fur in a beautiful black and white tuxedo pattern. And the black spot on her nose is the cutest thing you\u0027ll ever see! Eleven is a laidback lady who loves to be near her person and sitting on their lap. She is very sweet and loving! She is pretty calm and prefers to be with you rather than play, but she does love to attack small toy mice when she has them around her. Eleven is very calm around other cats, but prefers lower energy furry friends. She keeps her laid back demeanor around kids too. Eleven will use her voice when she wants food or water, but other than that she is a pretty quiet girl. Eleven will do well in a family home! She would do well with other cats and older children! She wants a calm home where she can get lots of love and be the center of attention! Life is full of stranger things, but Eleven isn\u0027t one of them! This sweet little girl will add joy to every life she touches! Eleven is FeLV+ (Feline Leukemia Virus), which causes a weakened immune system and requires special care. APA! provides some medical assistance after adoption. Cats with FeLV typically have a shortened lifespan. Eleven is not contagious to people or dogs, but should live only with other FeLV+ cats. For more information, please contact APA! or read more by our Partner, Best Friends Animal Society: http://bestfriends.org/Resources/FAQs-About-Feline-Leukemia-Virus-FeLV All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Eleven, please email [email protected]",

    "description": "Loving, Heartwarming, Gorgeous Tori is an a seasoned gentle-lady whose favorite pastime is to snuggle in your lap. \"Uber sweet\" has been used to describe this gal! Easily handled and fuss-free, Tori would do well with children, but being a quiet adult herself, she may prefer a grown-up companion. She likely gets along well with other kitties because her mild manner means she is pretty amicable. She sports a long, gorgeous dark coat and will appreciate some good grooming. When she\u0027s not plopped in your lap for pets or brushing, she may bat around a string or feather toys. Generally though, she is looking for a low-key household where she can get in some quality naps. Tori takes daily meds to control her hyperthyroidism, but she does great and doesn\u0027t complain. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Cuddly, Mellow, Attention-Loving How do you like your cuddles? Perhaps with a splash of fluffy softness in your arms or maybe you prefer a lap full of sweetness with a dollop of purrs? However you enjoy your warm and fuzzies, Shelly has you covered! This extremely affectionate cat is a people lover and does not hesitate to bring on the snuggles! Shelly was immediately sweet and friendly when she first arrived at her foster home and has been loving it up ever since. She happily rolls on the ground when you pet her and will tempt you with that siren song belly of hers. But, don\u0027t be fooled! That enticing, furry tummy is for viewing only as she is not fond of belly rubs! However, she\u0027s in heaven if you pet pretty much anywhere else on her gorgeous coat. Batting around toys now and then is sometimes entertaining for Shelly. However, she likes to spend most of her time lounging and looking pretty. Her favorite activity is welcoming you when you come home with rubs and adoration, hoping to get the petting train going! Shelly was a big fan of young children she met and especially enjoyed their gentle petting. She gets along with other cats and will interact with them if she\u0027s given time to feel comfortable in their company. If you\u0027re an easy going person who is big on snuggles, Shelly would be a perfect fit! She would also do well in a home with a loving family and would be fine with no pets or another cat or two. She might even make friends with a cat-friendly dog if given a slow introduction. However you like your cuddles, Shelly is ready to lay one on you! Contact us to meet her today! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Lovebug, Social, King of Your Lap After 15 years on the planet, Larry is a guy who knows what he wants and how to get it. His goal is to be in your lap, so the moment he meets you (if you are sitting down), he will jump into your lap! He is super friendly to all people, and would probably do well in a home with little humans - as long as they gently patted him A LOT. He wants to interact affectionately, which includes headbutts, rubbing up against you, and giving you the Googly Eyes. Larry is old enough to know that life is sweeter if he gets along with others, so he is good with other cats, too! He isn\u0027t much interested in playing, just likes to hang out and lounge around, all mellow-like. Larry would do best eating a kidney-supporting diet and drinking lots of water (maybe with a kitty fountain in his new home?). He has one eye that looks like it is winking at you - which he might be doing, flirt that he is! His home should include people who want a loving, older lap cat, who value him as a family member, and who want to connect with this adorable sweetheart. Contact us today to meet Larry! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Larry, please email [email protected]",

    "description": "Quiet, Sweet, Easy Fuzzy\u0027s gorgeous black coat and slender build give her an ultra elegant look. The piece de resistance is her gloriously fluffy tail! She\u0027s a quiet, sweet girl who has spent many days busily tending to her kittens. Now that her parenting duties have been fulfilled, she\u0027s more than ready to bask in sunbeams without interruption and to enjoy all the perks that go along with being a kitty of leisure. Fuzzy loves being petted and is particularly fond of head scratches. She will thank you for your time and affection with graceful leg rubs. She can be shy and doesn\u0027t actively seek out attention. But, we think a more outgoing side will increasingly emerge the further she gets from the wearing demands of motherhood. Fuzzy is bashful around kids, but gets along with calm, respectful ones. She\u0027s been known to hiss at dogs, but does so less than she once did. Fuzzy is not a vocal cat and isn\u0027t highly active. She\u0027s more of a tranquil, low-maintenance lady who simply wants to relax and quietly appreciate your company. Fuzzy would do best in a low-key home with no dogs or small children as she startles easily. She would be a perfect companion for someone seeking a gentle cat who likes to be petted, but isn\u0027t demanding of your attention. If you\u0027re ready to add a touch of class and a lifetime of love to your life, contact us to meet Fuzzy today! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

    "description": "Gentle, Sweet, Friend Are you looking for someone to talk to? Well, Bubba has a lot to say. He will happily sit with you for hours, and using his delightful meows, tell you all about the 16+ years of his life. He\u0027s got a lot of great stories! Bubba is the sweetest guy imaginable. He warms up to people instantly and is great with kids (even toddlers!). He\u0027s just looking for a comfy place to relax and enjoy life with people to give his affection to, and who will love him in return. Previous to his stay with APA!, Bubba had been declawed. As a result of this he must remain an indoor cat. He is on a diet of wet food only, and requires periodic subcutaneous fluids, which he takes like a champ (and APA! will show you how it\u0027s done!). He has Chronic Renal Disease, which means his kidneys are not functioning as well as they once were. This condition is so common in older cats that APA! offers a special adoption package for them. Read more about renal failure and adoption details here: http://www.austinpetsalive.org/2016/03/lives-worth-saving-cats-in-renal-failure If you have a cozy place in your home and your heart for a new old friend, Bubba is perfect for you! Contact us today to arrange a meet and greet with this gentleman cat. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Bubba, please email [email protected]",

    "description": "Sweet, Cuddly, Calm Being a senior cat is no easy feat -- there\u0027s a lot of lazing about, cuddling, and petting involved, but Betty is an absolute pro! She\u0027s just about as sweet as they come. She loves to snuggle up right next to you and be petted specifically on her head, ears, and neck for maximum purring. If you stop petting her too soon, she\u0027ll let you know by gently tapping you with her front paw -- and yes, that\u0027s as adorable as it sounds. You\u0027ll find this Siamese beauty impossible to resist. She\u0027s absolutely gorgeous! Betty loves to bask in the sunlight, and that\u0027s when her beautiful chocolate/apricot coloring truly glows. Betty is an absolute joy and very calm and friendly, but being a senior cat, she does need some special care. Her osteoarthritis causes her to walk with a bit of a limp, and she\u0027s not terribly active because of it. It would be ideal if her future family would encourage some mild playtime and monitor her food intake so she won\u0027t grow too plump. Betty is being treated for a minor skin fungus (aka ringworm); it\u0027s no big deal and will have no lasting effects! Before her stay with APA!, Betty had been declawed. As a result of this she must remain an indoor cat. These are all small potatoes compared to the big love you\u0027ll feel with Betty in your home! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Betty, please email [email protected]",

His best snuggling comes with great purrs! Like all kittens, he is full of energy, but he is great at keeping himself entertained! He would love to play with you too! Otter loves the adult cats in his foster home! He loves to follow them around, but he is good at taking a hint when they want a break from the new kitten in the house. Otter is a little nervous with new surroundings and he can hiss a little before he gets used to everything. He can be a scaredy cat, but he warms up quickly! Otter would do well in a home with other cat buddies he can play and hang out with! Otter also needs furrever humans who will be patient while he adapts to his new life!

    "description": "Adventurous, Playful, Affectionate Stockings starts purring the moment she sees you! She is affectionate and loves people, also purring anytime you pet her on her face, back, and even her belly. She doesn\u0027t mind being picked up, but her curiosity leaves her with little patience for being held for very long. Stockings is adventurous and fearless - there is no cat tower too tall for her to climb in a single bound! She will leap from ledge to ledge, and doesn\u0027t miss a beat getting right back up when she misses a step. Stockings loves any toy with a bell and enjoys chasing cat toys on a string. She prefers toys that move (instead of catnip toys that just lay there) - which she will quickly investigate! Stockings is petite and vocal. She will meow anytime her brother, Santa Paws, leaves her side - and until he returns. She rewards his snuggles with a purr also. She would do best in a home with another cat - especially if that other cat is Santa Paws! Stockings has a cute round face and big green eyes - contact us today to meet this adorable girl! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

He\u0027s so friendly in fact, he loves to cuddle up with other kitties for nap time and is just as likely to crawl into your lap as well. As you might guess, Ebenezer will be a fantastic addition to a household with other established cats but would prefer there are adult humans only. This gentle senior is looking for a happy, quiet home to be the best old man lap cat he can be. Ebenezer is a healthy FIV+ (Feline Immunodeficiency Virus) cat. FIV+ cats typically live long, healthy lives!

Toblerone knows how to make great use of available space, stretching out and draping himself over the edge of the sofa to maximize his lounge time! He will also snuggle next to you and purr himself to sleep. Toblerone would probably be great with kids, given his easy-going personality, playfulness, and cuddle-ability. He is fine around the resident adult cat in his foster home, but avoids the resident dog on principle. Toblerone has a beautiful gray and white marbled tabby coat and green eyes! He loves to be held and loved on. Contact us today to meet him! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip.

He is extremely active, but also loves to slow down and snuggle in your lap. His foster mom reports that he\u0027s the perfect mix of playful and sweet! Nausicaa loves children and does well with other cats, too. He hasn\u0027t yet met any dogs, but he\u0027s so easy-going and sweet that we have reason to think he\u0027d do just fine with a pal of the canine persuasion. Come meet this boy today and let him sit on your lap while he kneads and purrs. Your heart will melt, guaranteed. Nausicaa has tested positive for Feline Leukemia (FeLV). It is possible for kittens six months and younger to shed this virus completely and test negative, so Nausicaa will be re-tested for FeLV at his six month birthday, at which time a definitive diagnosis can be assured. Until then, Nausicaa should live with no other cats or kittens to ensure the virus is not passed. Nausicaa is available for adoption now to adopters who can accommodate a feline leukemia positive, or negative, cat as he is not yet of age to have a definitive test.

Evelyn is a special cat because she loves to be around people and close to you, but she isn\u0027t overly needy and desperate for attention. One of Evelyn\u0027s cutest quirks is her head bumps. She\u0027ll give you an adorable little nudge when she wants some love. She\u0027s also very chatty when it comes to feeding time and is almost always purring. Evelyn is super friendly, affectionate, and people-oriented! But she is stressed very easily (who can relate?); she doesn\u0027t love dogs or other cats so would likely be best as an only pet. She would be perfect for someone who wants a low-maintenance companion! If Evelyn sounds like the spunky lady you\u0027ve been searching for, don\u0027t hesitate to meet her! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Evelyn, please email [email protected]",
